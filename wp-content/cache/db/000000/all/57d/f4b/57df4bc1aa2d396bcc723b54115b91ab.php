<ol>
    <li><b>Can you explain the difference between </b><b><i>call</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>apply </i></b><b>to me</b><b><i>?</i></b>
The answer to this question is a bit of a factoid, so that if someone can answer it, it won't give you any information, but if they cannot, it will give a truckload. Almost all JavaScript programmer that has written a library or two (which most curious ones will, after programming it a few years) will know this.
Addendum: Several people are calling #1 into question. I must be very clear here that I stand firm on this one. If you haven't used apply, you are most likely missing out on the most powerful and overlooked aspects of the language. It's also an indicator that you haven't tried your hand at building a library yet, because when building libraries, apply and call are very commonly used.</li>
    <li><b>Can you explain </b><b><i>map </i></b><b>to me</b><b><i>?</i></b>
Map is a an extremely useful functional programming concept that any compsci person will know. If someone doesn't know this, it's a sign that they lack an understanding of computer science and/or lack an understanding of the language. In addition, the explanation itself will give you a sense of how much the person knows about the language just in the way they talk. If the person does well on this question, ask about <i>reduce</i> as a followup. If you do not know what map is, it means that you have done <i>zero</i> functional programming and you're missing out. Severely.</li>
    <li><b>Can you explain </b><b><i>bind </i></b><b>to me</b><b><i>?</i></b>
This is a really great question, because it delves into the concept of this. You can basically drill the interviewee for quite some time on this, as it is a very large subject. You'll get a good sense of a programmer by having this discussion.</li>
    <li><b>Can you explain how </b><b><i>closures</i></b><b> work to me</b><b><i>?</i></b>
This is a great question to ask programmers that claim to be experienced in general, but not with JavaScript. Closures are a general programming concept that is extraordinarily important in JavaScript. If they understand closures well, they will learn JavaScript pretty quickly.</li>
    <li><b>Can you please tell me a story about a JavaScript performance problem that you've encountered and how you approached solving it?</b>
This will tell you a lot about how much programming a person has actually done, in their own words. A big one to keep an eye out for is that they should be praising the Google Developer tools, and not rely too much on theoretical time complexity.</li>

<b>Study and Learn From Other People's Code</b>

First, in all my years of software development (30+ years), the single most important learning tool to me in all the languages I've learned has been to study and learn from other people's code.

Ideally, you want to be exposed to well written pieces of code that illustrate good design patterns and tools and techniques that you have not yet seen before.¬† But, you can actually learn from pretty much any code, even poorly written code (where you're more likely to learn things NOT to do).

In the Javascript world, pick up any third party library that seems useful and interesting to you such as jQuery, Angular, Underscore, Backbone, Modernizr, Async, etc...¬† Write some code using it (the non-minimized version).¬† Then, step through some of it's major functions in the debugger and see how to code works and is written.¬† Within seconds, you will likely see design patterns and techniques you aren't normally accustomed to. Understand those.¬†¬† Ask yourself why they are doing it that way and what advantages is it giving them.

Now, build an extension to that module.¬† Understand how the extension mechanism works and is architected.

Load a copy of the library into your code editor and just page down through it.¬† Look for new top level patterns that you aren't accustomed to. When you see one, stop and study it and understand what it's doing and why.

<b>Read and Answer Javascript Questions on Forums</b>

Then, second subscribe to the Javascript tag on StackOverflow and browse through questions and answers with that tag at least once a day.¬† There's a huge amount of Q&amp;A there.¬† It's noisy (there's a lot of not very useful stuff), but there are gems there too and there are very smart people providing answers.¬† And, bad answers will usually get quickly downvoted or removed so there's a useful filter on the information too.

You should be able to page through the titles and find several very useful answers every day that teach you things you did not know.¬† If you're really committed to learning, you can even start trying to answer questions.¬† This will cause you to have to try to solve someone else's problem and solve it in a way that community thinks is good code.¬† And, then you'll get feedback on how you did.¬† This is more time consuming, but if you put the effort in, it's very productive.¬† I find it better than reading books because every question is a real problem that someone else has that you're actually trying to solve and you get some feedback on how you did.
