<div class="info" style="text-align: left;">So I sort of fell into UX Design when I discovered a few years ago that what I was most passionate about was defining products and creating good, intuitive experiences that not only delighted users, but met product/business goals. My answer probably goes a bit more in depth than just learning the basics of UX design.

Here's a rough path to how I "picked up" UX design:</div>
<ol>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Read a few UX books such as Designing for the Digital Age, Don't Make Me Think, and The Inmates are Running the AsylumÂ  (this is a good way to learn just the very basics of UX. Don't Make Me Think is pretty much the "bible" of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">My daily/weekly readings would consist of UX blogs such as Boxes and Arrows (also a good way of picking up the basic understandings of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">I took a class on User Experience just to get the fundamentals/basics down - this class actually didn't teach me a lot since much of it was stuff I was doing already.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Probably the most powerful method of practicing/picking up UX design skills is just by doing UX design. For fun, I would look at the websites of products/services I used then redesign them in Illustrator or Photoshop. My goal was to improve the experience while also lightly guiding the user towards actions that met whatever the goal was.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Do user tests and user studies to see how people interact with products, and also to understand that what may be obvious to you or a product team isn't necessarily obvious to the end user. This is a good way to get a sense of how people interact with products - and also a good way to constantly remind yourself that you are not the target demographic. Real users think differently than those creating the products.Â Before design and, more specifically, user experience, was getting as much attention as it is now, I was doing user studies and user testing. At the time, I didn't know that what I was doing was user experience research until I attended an event where Karlyn Neel (Quora is being really slow right now and won't let me tag anything or anyone, sorry), lead designer of eBay's mobile app, spoke. When she spoke about design and creating for the user, I had an epiphany of sorts, in that, what I wanted to do was define products and delight users. So every step I'd taken after that was to become a design product manager - which brings me to</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue UX, then just start doing it even if you're in a position that's not technically in product or design. Example: I was working in the marketing department for a mid-stage startup where I owned the website. I treated the marketing site (the product was an API) like a product. I wasn't super passionate about Marketing beyond how I could get more visitors on our site to convert into leads, so I left and joined a gaming company as a design product manager. Now I'm a design product manager, or, product designer as we are more commonly known as.</li>
</ol>
Basically, what was once a hobby is now something I get paid for - except, it doesn't feel like just a job because I genuinely love doing what I'm doing. So if you're genuinely passionate about user experience and design, just start doing it and you'll learn the basics, and then some, as you go along.

In this post Iâ€™m going to build some simple Twisted website serving content over HTTP 2 and then create a client connecting to this sample site. Will there be any big difference in performance between HTTP 2 and HTTP 1.1? Will my demo site work quicker in HTTP2?

<h2 id="hello-http2">Hello HTTP2</h2>

Letâ€™s start with saying â€œHello world!â€ in HTTP 2 from Python Twisted.

<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/using-twistedweb.html">Twisted web server</a> already supports Python 3 so you can use 3 no problem. For this blog post Iâ€™m going to use Python 3.4.3. Iâ€™m assuming you have Twisted 16.3.0 with all HTTP2 dependencies installed. There is some minor bug in parsing optional dependencies in Python 3, so if youâ€™re using 3 you may need to install â€œh2â€ and â€œpriorityâ€ packages from pip manually instead of running <code>pip install twisted[h2]</code>.

Our website will serve content over HTTPS. While HTTP2 protocol itself does not require TLS, most client implementations (especially mainstream browsers) do require HTTPS. This means we need to start building our website with getting self signed certificates for local development. To generate self signed certificate you need to run following command:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># generate private key</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl genrsa &gt; privkey.pem
<span class="c"># generate certificate that will be stored in cert.pem file</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes</code></pre>

</figure>After running above command youâ€™ll need to fill out some details about you. You can ignore most of it or set some fake values, but keep in mind that some clients will refuse to connect if common name is not set to host name. Remember to put â€œlocalhostâ€ if openssl asks you about â€œcommon nameâ€.

Now that we have our ssl certificates letâ€™s build simple â€œhello worldâ€ Twisted resource serving HTTP2 over HTTPS.

Our resource will be really simplest possible and it will look like this:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Resource</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">isLeaf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">render_GET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s">"hello world (in HTTP2)"</span></code></pre>

</figure>Above code creates simple resource that will handle all request to root of website.

We now need to tell Twisted to listen on some specific port and serve our resource there using TLS. To actually launch our site on connection speaking SSL weâ€™ll use <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/endpoints.html">Twisted endpoints</a>. Endpoints are the recommended approach to do SSL in Twisted. In the past you could use Twisted DefaultSSLContextFactory, but this API is going to be deprecated in future releases. Factory misses lots of SSL features, is insecure and it wonâ€™t work properly with HTTP 2.

Hereâ€™s how you properly create instance of https website in Twisted:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># create instance of our web resource Index is instance of twisted.web.Resource</span>
<span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Site</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Index</span><span class="p">())</span>

<span class="c"># specify port and certificate</span>
<span class="n">endpoint_spec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"ssl:port=8080:privateKey=privkey.pem:certKey=cert.pem"</span>

</figure>Full hello world example will look like this:

</figure>So now we have Twisted server that has some alleged HTTP 2 support, but how do we actually test it? Obviously we need some HTTP2 client. One such client is curl. Unfortunately by default curl does not come with HTTP2 support. To be able to use HTTP2 you need to install optional dependencies and compile from source passing flag telling curl2 to compile with HTTP2 support. This is <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/video/curl-with-http2-support">nicely described here</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tools-for-debugging-testing-and-using-http-2/">also here</a>.

After installing curl you can test your website like this

<figure class="highlight">

</figure>You can see curl reports that it uses HTTP2 on connection level but then actual request part is HTTP 1.1. This is expected. HTTP2 does not change HTTP semantics, all HTTP verbs, headers etc is valid in HTTP2. Majority of HTTP2 happens on TCP connection level.

In your server logs you should see following messages:

<h2 id="hello-world-in-chrome">Hello world in Chrome</h2>

Why did I use curl and not just plain browser such as Chrome? The problem is that Chrome is super restrictive in HTTP 2 support. Chrome requires all connections to use ALPN protocol negotiation. This is<a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/supporting-http2-google-chrome-users/">discussed in detail here</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/day-google-chrome-disables-http2-nearly-everyone-may-31st-2016/">here</a>. To support ALPN your system has to have OpenSSL version above 1.0.2. At the moment of writing vast majority of Linux systems dont have OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed. Only Ubuntu 16.04 comes with OpenSSL 1.0.2. If youâ€™re on Linux Upgrading your OpenSSL system wide is not a trivial task. Iâ€™m not sure about Mac OS or Widows or other OS-es. I recommend you check your openssl version yourself, if itâ€™s above 1.0.2 youâ€™re good to go testing in Chrome. Otherwise I created simple <a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile here</a> using Ubuntu 16.04 and installing all dependencies, thereâ€™s also associated<a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Makefile">makefile here</a> that tells you how to build and run docker image.

Once you have all dependencies, you also need to make Chrome accept your fake self signed certificate. Steps how to accomplish this are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1757620">described here</a>

As you see making HTTP2 work in Chrome is not a trivial task. Once youâ€™re ready you can test HTTP2 support by opening dev tools. Enabling â€˜protocolâ€™ column will allow you to see version of protocol used in connection, e.g. your dev tools should show something like this:

<a href="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png"><img src="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png" /></a>

<h2 id="benchmark-http2-vs-http11">Benchmark HTTP2 vs HTTP1.1</h2>

Now that we know how to serve working (and secure) HTTP2 website with Twisted we can move to some more interesting things and compare differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2. Does it really matter if site is HTTP2 or HTTP1.1? Is there any real need to bother about HTTP2?

To try out things Iâ€™m going to build super simple online book store HTTP API. My book store will have 3000 science fiction books in store including classics by Ray Bradbury and Frank Herbert. I extracted data from goodreads.com with some trivial Scrapy project. You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/master/books.json">download data from here</a>. My bookstore will have initial page that lists all book ids in JSON. Each book will then have itâ€™s own page where you can see some page details. Client will randomly first request index list and it will then visit each specific page to see whatâ€™s there. One client will parse HTTP1.1, other one will parse HTTP2. Which one will be quicker?

My API will look like this:

Now letâ€™s see how HTTP1.1 client will perform when trying to crawl our SF bookstore. The client is going to be plain synchronous script using python-requests. It will first visit initial page with all book ids. After fetching all book ids it will request each book details page and read response. HTTP1.1 client will reuse one TCP connection. It will send â€˜connection: keep-aliveâ€™ header and all requests will be send one after another within one TCP connection.

</figure>Running above client on my test server produces following metrics:

</figure>This means that client needed around 5 seconds to process our sf website.

Now letâ€™s try HTTP2 client. In essence it will do same thing as HTTP1.1 client, it will connect to initial index page, fetch all books ids and request one book after another. The only difference is that the client will use <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed">HTTP2 multiplexing</a>. This means that instead of sending requests one after another and waiting for responses weâ€™ll send multiple requests at once and then weâ€™ll fetch responses. HTTP 1.1 allows you to reuse TCP connection but the process is:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>

</figure>from what I understand in HTTP2 the process is more like

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>

</figure>In HTTP1.1 if you have one slow response it will block connection. In HTTP2 you can send multiple requests to your server over one connection at the same time and then fetch responses as they arrive from origin.

To use HTTP2 to its full capabilities our client is going to send multiple requests over one connection and then fetch responses. It will split initial list of 3000 books into chunks of 100 urls. For every chunk it will start with sending 100 requests. In next step it will iterate over connection stream ids and fetch responses.

Iâ€™m going to use <a href="https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper">python-hyper</a> as underlying client library. Twisted does not yet support HTTP2 client side, but work on supporting it is in progress.

</figure>To sum up HTTP2 client is faster, but it also works slightly differently. If you were to use HTTP2 in same way as HTTP1.1 (just send one request after another within one connection) performance difference would be small or non-existent. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I didnt go into details of other HTTP2 improvements (such as headers compression or server push). These other benefits of HTTP2 are certainly equally important as multiplexing of messages over one connection. Iâ€™m not sure if you can use server push from Twisted though.

HTTP2 is not available by default, to get it you need to install <a href="https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2">hyper-h2</a> (just run<code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install twisted[h2]</code>). This is really big and exciting news for whole Python ecosystem so itâ€™s worth seeing how it works and how difficult or easy it is to set up.

In this post Iâ€™m going to build some simple Twisted website serving content over HTTP 2 and then create a client connecting to this sample site. Will there be any big difference in performance between HTTP 2 and HTTP 1.1? Will my demo site work quicker in HTTP2?
<h2 id="hello-http2">Hello HTTP2</h2>
Letâ€™s start with saying â€œHello world!â€ in HTTP 2 from Python Twisted.

<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/using-twistedweb.html">Twisted web server</a> already supports Python 3 so you can use 3 no problem. For this blog post Iâ€™m going to use Python 3.4.3. Iâ€™m assuming you have Twisted 16.3.0 with all HTTP2 dependencies installed. There is some minor bug in parsing optional dependencies in Python 3, so if youâ€™re using 3 you may need to install â€œh2â€ and â€œpriorityâ€ packages from pip manually instead of running <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install twisted[h2]</code>.

Our website will serve content over HTTPS. While HTTP2 protocol itself does not require TLS, most client implementations (especially mainstream browsers) do require HTTPS. This means we need to start building our website with getting self signed certificates for local development. To generate self signed certificate you need to run following command:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># generate private key</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl genrsa &gt; privkey.pem
<span class="c"># generate certificate that will be stored in cert.pem file</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes</code></pre>
</figure>After running above command youâ€™ll need to fill out some details about you. You can ignore most of it or set some fake values, but keep in mind that some clients will refuse to connect if common name is not set to host name. Remember to put â€œlocalhostâ€ if openssl asks you about â€œcommon nameâ€.

Now that we have our ssl certificates letâ€™s build simple â€œhello worldâ€ Twisted resource serving HTTP2 over HTTPS.

Our resource will be really simplest possible and it will look like this:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Resource</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">isLeaf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">render_GET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s">"hello world (in HTTP2)"</span></code></pre>
</figure>Above code creates simple resource that will handle all request to root of website.

We now need to tell Twisted to listen on some specific port and serve our resource there using TLS. To actually launch our site on connection speaking SSL weâ€™ll use <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/endpoints.html">Twisted endpoints</a>. Endpoints are the recommended approach to do SSL in Twisted. In the past you could use Twisted DefaultSSLContextFactory, but this API is going to be deprecated in future releases. Factory misses lots of SSL features, is insecure and it wonâ€™t work properly with HTTP 2.

Hereâ€™s how you properly create instance of https website in Twisted:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># create instance of our web resource Index is instance of twisted.web.Resource</span>

</figure>So now we have Twisted server that has some alleged HTTP 2 support, but how do we actually test it? Obviously we need some HTTP2 client. One such client is curl. Unfortunately by default curl does not come with HTTP2 support. To be able to use HTTP2 you need to install optional dependencies and compile from source passing flag telling curl2 to compile with HTTP2 support. This is <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/video/curl-with-http2-support">nicely described here</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tools-for-debugging-testing-and-using-http-2/">also here</a>.

After installing curl you can test your website like this

</figure>You can see curl reports that it uses HTTP2 on connection level but then actual request part is HTTP 1.1. This is expected. HTTP2 does not change HTTP semantics, all HTTP verbs, headers etc is valid in HTTP2. Majority of HTTP2 happens on TCP connection level.

In your server logs you should see following messages:

<h2 id="hello-world-in-chrome">Hello world in Chrome</h2>
Why did I use curl and not just plain browser such as Chrome? The problem is that Chrome is super restrictive in HTTP 2 support. Chrome requires all connections to use ALPN protocol negotiation. This is<a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/supporting-http2-google-chrome-users/">discussed in detail here</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/day-google-chrome-disables-http2-nearly-everyone-may-31st-2016/">here</a>. To support ALPN your system has to have OpenSSL version above 1.0.2. At the moment of writing vast majority of Linux systems dont have OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed. Only Ubuntu 16.04 comes with OpenSSL 1.0.2. If youâ€™re on Linux Upgrading your OpenSSL system wide is not a trivial task. Iâ€™m not sure about Mac OS or Widows or other OS-es. I recommend you check your openssl version yourself, if itâ€™s above 1.0.2 youâ€™re good to go testing in Chrome. Otherwise I created simple <a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile here</a> using Ubuntu 16.04 and installing all dependencies, thereâ€™s also associated<a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Makefile">makefile here</a> that tells you how to build and run docker image.

Once you have all dependencies, you also need to make Chrome accept your fake self signed certificate. Steps how to accomplish this are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1757620">described here</a>

As you see making HTTP2 work in Chrome is not a trivial task. Once youâ€™re ready you can test HTTP2 support by opening dev tools. Enabling â€˜protocolâ€™ column will allow you to see version of protocol used in connection, e.g. your dev tools should show something like this:

<a href="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png"><img src="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png" /></a>
<h2 id="benchmark-http2-vs-http11">Benchmark HTTP2 vs HTTP1.1</h2>
Now that we know how to serve working (and secure) HTTP2 website with Twisted we can move to some more interesting things and compare differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2. Does it really matter if site is HTTP2 or HTTP1.1? Is there any real need to bother about HTTP2?

To try out things Iâ€™m going to build super simple online book store HTTP API. My book store will have 3000 science fiction books in store including classics by Ray Bradbury and Frank Herbert. I extracted data from goodreads.com with some trivial Scrapy project. You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/master/books.json">download data from here</a>. My bookstore will have initial page that lists all book ids in JSON. Each book will then have itâ€™s own page where you can see some page details. Client will randomly first request index list and it will then visit each specific page to see whatâ€™s there. One client will parse HTTP1.1, other one will parse HTTP2. Which one will be quicker?

My API will look like this:

Now letâ€™s see how HTTP1.1 client will perform when trying to crawl our SF bookstore. The client is going to be plain synchronous script using python-requests. It will first visit initial page with all book ids. After fetching all book ids it will request each book details page and read response. HTTP1.1 client will reuse one TCP connection. It will send â€˜connection: keep-aliveâ€™ header and all requests will be send one after another within one TCP connection.

</figure>This means that client needed around 5 seconds to process our sf website.

Now letâ€™s try HTTP2 client. In essence it will do same thing as HTTP1.1 client, it will connect to initial index page, fetch all books ids and request one book after another. The only difference is that the client will use <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed">HTTP2 multiplexing</a>. This means that instead of sending requests one after another and waiting for responses weâ€™ll send multiple requests at once and then weâ€™ll fetch responses. HTTP 1.1 allows you to reuse TCP connection but the process is:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>
</figure>from what I understand in HTTP2 the process is more like

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>
</figure>In HTTP1.1 if you have one slow response it will block connection. In HTTP2 you can send multiple requests to your server over one connection at the same time and then fetch responses as they arrive from origin.

To use HTTP2 to its full capabilities our client is going to send multiple requests over one connection and then fetch responses. It will split initial list of 3000 books into chunks of 100 urls. For every chunk it will start with sending 100 requests. In next step it will iterate over connection stream ids and fetch responses.

Iâ€™m going to use <a href="https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper">python-hyper</a> as underlying client library. Twisted does not yet support HTTP2 client side, but work on supporting it is in progress.

</figure>To sum up HTTP2 client is faster, but it also works slightly differently. If you were to use HTTP2 in same way as HTTP1.1 (just send one request after another within one connection) performance difference would be small or non-existent. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I didnt go into details of other HTTP2 improvements (such as headers compression or server push). These other benefits of HTTP2 are certainly equally important as multiplexing of messages over one connection. Iâ€™m not sure if you can use server push from Twisted though.

<b>Study and Learn From Other People's Code</b>

First, in all my years of software development (30+ years), the single most important learning tool to me in all the languages I've learned has been to study and learn from other people's code.

Ideally, you want to be exposed to well written pieces of code that illustrate good design patterns and tools and techniques that you have not yet seen before.Â  But, you can actually learn from pretty much any code, even poorly written code (where you're more likely to learn things NOT to do).

In the Javascript world, pick up any third party library that seems useful and interesting to you such as jQuery, Angular, Underscore, Backbone, Modernizr, Async, etc...Â  Write some code using it (the non-minimized version).Â  Then, step through some of it's major functions in the debugger and see how to code works and is written.Â  Within seconds, you will likely see design patterns and techniques you aren't normally accustomed to. Understand those.Â Â  Ask yourself why they are doing it that way and what advantages is it giving them.

Now, build an extension to that module.Â  Understand how the extension mechanism works and is architected.

Load a copy of the library into your code editor and just page down through it.Â  Look for new top level patterns that you aren't accustomed to. When you see one, stop and study it and understand what it's doing and why.

<b>Read and Answer Javascript Questions on Forums</b>

Then, second subscribe to the Javascript tag on StackOverflow and browse through questions and answers with that tag at least once a day.Â  There's a huge amount of Q&amp;A there.Â  It's noisy (there's a lot of not very useful stuff), but there are gems there too and there are very smart people providing answers.Â  And, bad answers will usually get quickly downvoted or removed so there's a useful filter on the information too.

You should be able to page through the titles and find several very useful answers every day that teach you things you did not know.Â  If you're really committed to learning, you can even start trying to answer questions.Â  This will cause you to have to try to solve someone else's problem and solve it in a way that community thinks is good code.Â  And, then you'll get feedback on how you did.Â  This is more time consuming, but if you put the effort in, it's very productive.Â  I find it better than reading books because every question is a real problem that someone else has that you're actually trying to solve and you get some feedback on how you did.

Map is a an extremely useful functional programming concept that any compsci person will know.

    <li><b>Can you explain how </b><b><i>closures</i></b><b> work to me</b><b><i>?</i></b>
This is a great question to ask programmers that claim to be experienced in general, but not with JavaScript. Closures are a general programming concept that is extraordinarily important in JavaScript. If they understand closures well, they will learn JavaScript pretty quickly.</li>

This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.

A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100 (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be ignored by a user agent.

Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request, then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).)

The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed. See section 8.2.3 for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).

<div id="switching_protocols" class="collapse">

The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade message header field (section 14.42), for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which terminates the 101 response.

The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.

<div id="processing" class="collapse">

The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.

Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.

There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.

The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the request's current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.

Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.

The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.

The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).

Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.

The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.

Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by "captive portals" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure. It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.

A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so ("unknown clients") using their MAC addresses.

Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the "login server") dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.

In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL. This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.

However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.

Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.

<div id="processing" class="collapse">

The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.

Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response, with the most specific URI for the resource given by a Location header field. The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.

There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this.

The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the request's current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.

The response MUST include the following header fields:
<ul>

If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly, see 13.5.4.

A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.

The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client.</blockquote>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard.[2] The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.

The response MUST include the following header fields:

If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.

Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.

The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request.

Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection.
<blockquote>Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a 406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.</blockquote>
If the response could be unacceptable, a user agent SHOULD temporarily stop receipt of more data and query the user for a decision on further actions.

<div id="conflict" class="collapse">

The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict. Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be possible and is not required.

Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the response entity would likely contain a list of the differences between the two versions in a format defined by the response Content-Type.

<div id="gone" class="collapse">

The requested resource is no longer available at the server and no forwarding address is known. This condition is expected to be considered permanent. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD delete references to the Request-URI after user approval. If the server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) SHOULD be used instead. This response is cacheable unless indicated otherwise.

The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed. Such an event is common for limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the discretion of the server owner.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again. This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found" may be used instead.

<div id="net_authn_required" class="collapse">

The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.

The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).

Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.

The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.

Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by "captive portals" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure. It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.

A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so ("unknown clients") using their MAC addresses.

Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the "login server") dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.

In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL. This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.

However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.

Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.

When resources are named well, an API is intuitive and easy to use. Done poorly, that same API can feel klutzy and be difficult to use and understand. Below are a few tips to get you going when creating the resource URIs for your new API.

Essentially, a RESTful API ends up being simply a collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some JSON and/or XML representations of resources, many of which will contain relational links. The RESTful principal of addressability is covered by the URIs. Each resource has its own address or URIâ€”every interesting piece of information the server can provide is exposed as a resource. The constraint of uniform interface is partially addressed by the combination of URIs and HTTP verbs, and using them in line with the standards and conventions.

In deciding what resources are within your system, name them as nouns as opposed to verbs or actions. In other words, a RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing instead of referring to an action. Nouns have properties as verbs do not, just another distinguishing factor.

Some example resources are:

<ul>
    <li>Users of the system.</li>
    <li>Courses in which a student is enrolled.</li>
    <li>A user's timeline of posts.</li>
    <li>The users that follow another user.</li>
    <li>An article about horseback riding.</li>
</ul>

Each resource in a service suite will have at least one URI identifying it. And it's best when that URI makes sense and adequately describes the resource. URIs should follow a predictable, hierarchical structure to enhance understandability and, therefore, usability: predictable in the sense that they're consistent, hierarchical in the sense that data has structureâ€”relationships. This is not a REST rule or constraint, but it enhances the API.

RESTful APIs are written for consumers. The name and structure of URIs should convey meaning to those consumers. It's often difficult to know what the data boundaries should be, but with understanding of your data, you most-likely are equipped to take a stab and what makes sense to return as a representation to your clients. Design for your clients, not for your data.

Let's say we're describing an order system with customers, orders, line items, products, etc. Consider the URIs involved in describing the resources in this service suite:

<h3>Resource URI Examples</h3>

To insert (create) a new customer in the system, we might use:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

To read a customer with Customer ID# 33245:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em> The same URI would be used for PUT and DELETE, to update and delete, respectively.

Here are proposed URIs for products:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/products</em> for creating a new product.

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/products/66432</em>
for reading, updating, deleting product 66432, respectively.

Now, here is where it gets fun... What about creating a new order for a customer? One option might be: POST http://www.example.com/orders And that could work to create an order, but it's arguably outside the context of a customer.

Because we want to create an order for a customer (note the relationship), this URI perhaps is not as intuitive as it could be. It could be argued that the following URI would offer better clarity: <em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em> Now we know we're creating an order for customer ID# 33245.

Now what would the following return?
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em>
Probably a list of orders that customer #33245 has created or owns. Note: we may choose to not support DELETE or PUT for that url since it's operating on a collection.

Now, to continue the hierarchical concept, what about the following URI?
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems</em>
That might add a line item to order #8769 (which is for customer #33245). Right! GET for that URI might return all the line items for that order. However, if line items don't make sense only in customer context or also make sense outside the context of a customer, we would offer a POST www.example.com/orders/8769/lineitems URI.

Along those lines, because there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, we might also offer a GET http://www.example.com/orders/8769 URI that supports retrieving an order by number without having to know the customer number.

To go one layer deeper in the hierarchy:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1</em>
Might return only the first line item in that same order.

By now you can see how the hierarchy concept works. There aren't any hard and fast rules, only make sure the imposed structure makes sense to consumers of your services. As with everything in the craft of Software Development, naming is critical to success.

Look at some widely used APIs to get the hang of this and leverage the intuition of your teammates to refine your API resource URIs. Some example APIs are:

<ul>
    <li>Twitter: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api</li>
    <li>Facebook: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/</li>
    <li>LinkedIn: https://developer.linkedin.com/apis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resource Naming Anti-Patterns</h3>

While we've discussed some examples of appropriate resource names, sometimes it's informative to see some anti-patterns. Below are some examples of poor RESTful resource URIs seen in the "wild." These are examples of what not to do!

First up, often services use a single URI to specify the service interface, using query-string parameters to specify the requested operation and/or HTTP verb. For example to update customer with ID 12345, the request for a JSON body might be:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/services?op=update_customer&amp;id=12345&amp;format=json</em>

By now, you're above doing this. Even though the 'services' URL node is a noun, this URL is not self- descriptive as the URI hierarchy is the same for all requests. Plus, it uses GET as the HTTP verb even though we're performing an update. This is counter-intuitive and is painful (even dangerous) to use as a client.

Here's another example following the same operation of updating a customer:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/update_customer/12345</em>

And its evil twin:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

You'll see this one a lot as you visit other developer's service suites. Note that the developer is attempting to create RESTful resource names and has made some progress. But you're better than this â€”able to identify the verb phrase in the URL. Notice that we don't need to use the 'update' verb phrase in the URL because we can rely on the HTTP verb to inform that operation. Just to clarify, the following resource URL is redundant:

<em>PUT http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

With both PUT and 'update' in the request, we're offering to confuse our service consumers! Is 'update' the resource? So, we've spent some time beating the horse at this point. I'm certain you understand...

<h3>Pluralization</h3>

Let's talk about the debate between the pluralizers and the "singularizers"... Haven't heard of that debate? It does exist. Essentially, it boils down to this question...

Should URI nodes in your hierarchy be named using singular or plural nouns? For example, should your URI for retrieving a representation of a customer resource look like this:

<em>GET http://www.example.com/customer/33245</em> or: <em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em>

There are good arguments on both sides, but the commonly-accepted practice is to always use plurals in node names to keep your API URIs consistent across all HTTP methods. The reasoning is based on the concept that customers are a collection within the service suite and the ID (e.g. 33245) refers to one of those customers in the collection.

Using this rule, an example multi-node URI using pluralization would look like (emphasis added):

<em>GET http://www.example.com/<strong>customers</strong>/33245/<strong>orders</strong>/8769/<strong>lineitems</strong>/1</em>

with 'customers', 'orders', and 'lineitems' URI nodes all being their plural forms.

This implies that you only really need two base URLs for each root resource. One for creation of the resource within a collection and the second for reading, updating and deleting the resource by its identifier. For example the creation case, using customers as the example, is handled by the following URL:

<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

And the read, update and delete cases are handled by the following:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/{id}</em>

As mentioned earlier, there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, but as a minimum full CRUD capabilities are aptly handled with two simple URIs.

You ask if there is a case where pluralization doesn't make sense. Well, yes, in fact there is. When there isn't a collection concept in play. In other words, it's acceptable to use a singularized resource name when there can only be one of the resourceâ€”it's a singleton resource. For example, if there was a single, overarching configuration resource, you might use a singularized noun to represent that:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/configuration</em>

Note the lack of a configuration ID and usage of POST verb. And say that there was only one configuration per customer, then the URL might be:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/configuration</em>

Again, no ID for the configuration and no POST verb usage. Although, I'm sure that in both of these cases POST usage might be argued to be valid. Well...

The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our â€œuniform interfaceâ€ constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently.

Below is a more-detailed discussion of the main HTTP methods.
<h3>POST</h3>
The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.

On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests. Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em></li>
    <li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>GET</h3>
The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the â€œhappyâ€ (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET (along with HEAD) requests are used only to read data and not change it. Therefore, when used this way, they are considered safe. That is, they can be called without risk of data modification or corruptionâ€”calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times, or none at all. Additionally, GET (and HEAD) is idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests ends up having the same result as a single request.

Do not expose unsafe operations via GETâ€”it should never modify any resources on the server.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PUT</h3>
PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.

Alternatively, use POST to create new resources and provide the client-defined ID in the body representationâ€”presumably to a URI that doesn't include the ID of the resource (see POST below).

On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. A body in the response is optionalâ€”providing one consumes more bandwidth. It is not necessary to return a link via a Location header in the creation case since the client already set the resource ID.

PUT is not a safe operation, in that it modifies (or creates) state on the server, but it is idempotent. In other words, if you create or update a resource using PUT and then make that same call again, the resource is still there and still has the same state as it did with the first call.

If, for instance, calling PUT on a resource increments a counter within the resource, the call is no longer idempotent. Sometimes that happens and it may be enough to document that the call is not idempotent. However, it's recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent. It is strongly recommended to use POST for non-idempotent requests.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PATCH</h3>
</div>
PATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.

This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.

PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. However, a PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base-point or else they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch application should use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource. For example, the client can use a strong ETag in an If-Match header on the PATCH request.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>DELETE</h3>
DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.

On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps the representation of the deleted item (often demands too much bandwidth), or a wrapped response (see Return Values below). Either that or return HTTP status 204 (NO CONTENT) with no response body. In other words, a 204 status with no body, or the JSEND-style response and HTTP status 200 are the recommended responses.

HTTP-spec-wise, DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it's removed. Repeatedly calling DELETE on that resource ends up the same: the resource is gone. If calling DELETE say, decrements a counter (within the resource), the DELETE call is no longer idempotent. As mentioned previously, usage statistics and measurements may be updated while still considering the service idempotent as long as no resource data is changed. Using POST for non-idempotent resource requests is recommended.

There is a caveat about DELETE idempotence, however. Calling DELETE on a resource a second time will often return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed and therefore is no longer findable. This, by some opinions, makes DELETE operations no longer idempotent, however, the end-state of the resource is the same. Returning a 404 is acceptable and communicates accurately the status of the call.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/bucket/sample</em></li>

The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our â€œuniform interfaceâ€ constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used more often than others.

Below is a table summarizing recommended return values of the primary HTTP methods in combination with the resource URIs:

Below is a more-detailed discussion of the main HTTP methods.
<h3>POST</h3>
The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.

On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests. Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em></li>
 	<li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>GET</h3>
The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the â€œhappyâ€ (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET (along with HEAD) requests are used only to read data and not change it. Therefore, when used this way, they are considered safe. That is, they can be called without risk of data modification or corruptionâ€”calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times, or none at all. Additionally, GET (and HEAD) is idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests ends up having the same result as a single request.

Do not expose unsafe operations via GETâ€”it should never modify any resources on the server.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
 	<li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
 	<li><em>GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PUT</h3>
PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.

Alternatively, use POST to create new resources and provide the client-defined ID in the body representationâ€”presumably to a URI that doesn't include the ID of the resource (see POST below).

On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. A body in the response is optionalâ€”providing one consumes more bandwidth. It is not necessary to return a link via a Location header in the creation case since the client already set the resource ID.

PUT is not a safe operation, in that it modifies (or creates) state on the server, but it is idempotent. In other words, if you create or update a resource using PUT and then make that same call again, the resource is still there and still has the same state as it did with the first call.

If, for instance, calling PUT on a resource increments a counter within the resource, the call is no longer idempotent. Sometimes that happens and it may be enough to document that the call is not idempotent. However, it's recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent. It is strongly recommended to use POST for non-idempotent requests.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
 	<li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
 	<li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PATCH</h3>
</div>
PATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.

This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.

PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. However, a PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base-point or else they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch application should use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource. For example, the client can use a strong ETag in an If-Match header on the PATCH request.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
 	<li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
 	<li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>DELETE</h3>
DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.

On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps the representation of the deleted item (often demands too much bandwidth), or a wrapped response (see Return Values below).

These six quick tips will result in better, more usable services.

<h2>Use HTTP Verbs to Make Your Requests Mean Something</h2>

API consumers are capable of sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs, which greatly enhance the clarity of a given request.

Generally, the four primary HTTP verbs are used as follows:

<dl>
    <dt>GET</dt>
    <dd>Read a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.</dd>
    <dt>PUT</dt>
    <dd>Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources. Can also be used to create a specific resource if the resource identifier is know before-hand.</dd>
    <dt>DELETE</dt>
    <dd>Remove/delete a specific resource by an identifier.</dd>
    <dt>POST</dt>
    <dd>Create a new resource. Also a catch-all verb for operations that don't fit into the other categories.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Note</h3>

GET requests must not change any underlying resource data. Measurements and tracking which update data may still occur, but the resource data identified by the URI should not change.

<h2>Provide Sensible Resource Names</h2>

Producing a great API is 80% art and 20% science. Creating a URL hierarchy representing sensible resources is the art part. Having sensible resource names (which are just URL paths, such as /customers/12345/orders) improves the clarity of what a given request does.

Appropriate resource names provide context for a service request, increasing understandability of the API. Resources are viewed hierarchically via their URI names, offering consumers a friendly, easily-understood hierarchy of resources to leverage in their applications.

Here are some quick-hit rules for URL path (resource name) design:

<ul>
    <li>Use identifiers in your URLs instead of in the query-string. Using URL query-string parameters is fantastic for filtering, but not for resource names.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Good:</strong> /users/12345</li>
    <li><strong>Poor:</strong> /api?type=user&amp;id=23</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Leverage the hierarchical nature of the URL to imply structure.</li>
    <li>Design for your clients, not for your data.</li>
    <li>Resource names should be nouns. Avoid verbs as resource names, to improve clarity. Use the HTTP methods to specify the verb portion of the request.</li>
    <li>Use plurals in URL segments to keep your API URIs consistent across all HTTP methods, using the collection metaphor.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> /customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1</li>
    <li><strong>Not:</strong> /customer/33245/order/8769/lineitem/1</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Avoid using collection verbiage in URLs. For example 'customer_list' as a resource. Use pluralization to indicate the collection metaphor (e.g. customers vs. customer_list).</li>
    <li>Use lower-case in URL segments, separating words with underscores ('_') or hyphens ('-'). Some servers ignore case so it's best to be clear.</li>
    <li>Keep URLs as short as possible, with as few segments as makes sense.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use HTTP Response Codes to Indicate Status</h2>

Response status codes are part of the HTTP specification. There are quite a number of them to address the most common situations. In the spirit of having our RESTful services embrace the HTTP specification, our Web APIs should return relevant HTTP status codes. For example, when a resource is successfully created (e.g. from a POST request), the API should return HTTP status code 201. A list of valid <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html">HTTP status codes</a> is available <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html">here</a> which lists detailed descriptions of each.

Suggested usages for the "Top 10" HTTP Response Status Codes are as follows:

<dl>
    <dt>200 OK</dt>
    <dd>General success status code. This is the most common code. Used to indicate success.</dd>
    <dt>201 CREATED</dt>
    <dd>Successful creation occurred (via either POST or PUT). Set the Location header to contain a link to the newly-created resource (on POST). Response body content may or may not be present.</dd>
    <dt>204 NO CONTENT</dt>
    <dd>Indicates success but nothing is in the response body, often used for DELETE and PUT operations.</dd>
    <dt>400 BAD REQUEST</dt>
    <dd>General error for when fulfilling the request would cause an invalid state. Domain validation errors, missing data, etc. are some examples.</dd>
    <dt>401 UNAUTHORIZED</dt>
    <dd>Error code response for missing or invalid authentication token.</dd>
    <dt>403 FORBIDDEN</dt>
    <dd>Error code for when the user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason (e.g. time constraints, etc.).</dd>
    <dt>404 NOT FOUND</dt>
    <dd>Used when the requested resource is not found, whether it doesn't exist or if there was a 401 or 403 that, for security reasons, the service wants to mask.</dd>
    <dt>405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED</dt>
    <dd>Used to indicate that the requested URL exists, but the requested HTTP method is not applicable. For example, POST <em>/users/12345</em> where the API doesn't support creation of resources this way (with a provided ID). The Allow HTTP header must be set when returning a 405 to indicate the HTTP methods that are supported. In the previous case, the header would look like "Allow: GET, PUT, DELETE"</dd>
    <dt>409 CONFLICT</dt>
    <dd>Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request. Duplicate entries, such as trying to create two customers with the same information, and deleting root objects when cascade-delete is not supported are a couple of examples.</dd>
    <dt>500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR</dt>
    <dd>Never return this intentionally. The general catch-all error when the server-side throws an exception. Use this only for errors that the consumer cannot address from their end.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Offer Both JSON and XML</h2>

Favor JSON support unless you're in a highly-standardized and regulated industry that requires XML, schema validation and namespaces, and offer both JSON and XML unless the costs are staggering. Ideally, let consumers switch between formats using the HTTP Accept header, or by just changing an extension from .xml to .json on the URL.

Be aware that as soon as we start talking about XML support, we start talking about schemas for validation, namespaces, etc. Unless required by your industry, avoid supporting all that complexity initially, if ever. JSON is designed to be simple, terse and functional. Make your XML look like that if you can.

In other words, make the XML that is returned more JSON-like â€” simple and easy to read, without the schema and namespace details present, just data and links. If it ends up being more complex than this, the cost of XML will be staggering. In my experience no one has used XML responses anyway for the last several years, it's just too expensive to consume.

Note that <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> offers schema-style validation capabilities, if you need that sort of thing.

<h2>Create Fine-Grained Resources</h2>

When starting out, it's best to create APIs that mimic the underlying application domain or database architecture of your system. Eventually, you'll want aggregate services that utilize multiple underlying resources to reduce chattiness. However, it's much easier to create larger resources later from individual resources than it is to create fine-grained or individual resources from larger aggregates. Make it easy on yourself and start with small, easily defined resources, providing CRUD functionality on those. You can create those use-case-oriented, chattiness-reducing resources later.

<h2>Consider Connectedness</h2>

One of the principles of REST is connectednessâ€”via hypermedia links (search HATEOAS). While services are still useful without them, APIs become more self-descriptive and discoverable when links are returned in the response. At the very least, a 'self' link reference informs clients how the data was or can be retrieved. Additionally, utilize the HTTP Location header to contain a link on resource creation via POST (or PUT). For collections returned in a response that support pagination, 'first', 'last', 'next' and 'prev' links at a minimum are very helpful.

Regarding linking formats, there are many. The HTTP Web Linking Specification (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5988">RFC5988</a>) explains a link as follows:

<blockquote>a link is a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3987">RFC3987</a>], and is comprised of:
<ul>
    <li>A context IRI,</li>
    <li>a link relation type</li>
    <li>a target IRI, and</li>
    <li>optionally, target attributes.</li>
</ul>
A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target attributes}."</blockquote>

At the very least, place links in the HTTP Link header as recommended in the specification, or embrace a JSON representation of this HTTP link style (such as Atom-style links, see: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4287#section-4.2.7">RFC4287</a>) in your JSON representations. Later, you can layer in more complex linking styles such as <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL+JSON</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collection+JSON</a>, and/or <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, etc. as your REST APIs become more mature.

The Allow HTTP header must be set when returning a 405 to indicate the HTTP methods that are supported. In the previous case, the header would look like "Allow: GET, PUT, DELETE"</dd>
 	<dt>409 CONFLICT</dt>
 	<dd>Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request. Duplicate entries, such as trying to create two customers with the same information, and deleting root objects when cascade-delete is not supported are a couple of examples.</dd>

 	<dd>Never return this intentionally. The general catch-all error when the server-side throws an exception. Use this only for errors that the consumer cannot address from their end.</dd>

<h2>Offer Both JSON and XML</h2>
Favor JSON support unless you're in a highly-standardized and regulated industry that requires XML, schema validation and namespaces, and offer both JSON and XML unless the costs are staggering. Ideally, let consumers switch between formats using the HTTP Accept header, or by just changing an extension from .xml to .json on the URL.

Be aware that as soon as we start talking about XML support, we start talking about schemas for validation, namespaces, etc. Unless required by your industry, avoid supporting all that complexity initially, if ever. JSON is designed to be simple, terse and functional. Make your XML look like that if you can.

In other words, make the XML that is returned more JSON-like â€” simple and easy to read, without the schema and namespace details present, just data and links. If it ends up being more complex than this, the cost of XML will be staggering. In my experience no one has used XML responses anyway for the last several years, it's just too expensive to consume.

Note that <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> offers schema-style validation capabilities, if you need that sort of thing.
<h2>Create Fine-Grained Resources</h2>
When starting out, it's best to create APIs that mimic the underlying application domain or database architecture of your system. Eventually, you'll want aggregate services that utilize multiple underlying resources to reduce chattiness. However, it's much easier to create larger resources later from individual resources than it is to create fine-grained or individual resources from larger aggregates. Make it easy on yourself and start with small, easily defined resources, providing CRUD functionality on those. You can create those use-case-oriented, chattiness-reducing resources later.
<h2>Consider Connectedness</h2>
One of the principles of REST is connectednessâ€”via hypermedia links (search HATEOAS). While services are still useful without them, APIs become more self-descriptive and discoverable when links are returned in the response. At the very least, a 'self' link reference informs clients how the data was or can be retrieved. Additionally, utilize the HTTP Location header to contain a link on resource creation via POST (or PUT). For collections returned in a response that support pagination, 'first', 'last', 'next' and 'prev' links at a minimum are very helpful.

Regarding linking formats, there are many. The HTTP Web Linking Specification (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5988">RFC5988</a>) explains a link as follows:
<blockquote>a link is a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3987">RFC3987</a>], and is comprised of:
<ul>
 	<li>A context IRI,</li>
 	<li>a link relation type</li>
 	<li>a target IRI, and</li>
 	<li>optionally, target attributes.</li>
</ul>
A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target attributes}."</blockquote>
At the very least, place links in the HTTP Link header as recommended in the specification, or embrace a JSON representation of this HTTP link style (such as Atom-style links, see: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4287#section-4.2.7">RFC4287</a>) in your JSON representations. Later, you can layer in more complex linking styles such as <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL+JSON</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collection+JSON</a>, and/or <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, etc. as your REST APIs become more mature.

Chris Lattner, a senior director of the Developer Tools Department at Apple, today <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160725/025676.html">posted a lengthy note to the Swift mailing list</a> that looks back at the development of Swift 3.0 and sets some expectations for Swift 4.0 next year.

The note is worth reading in its entirety for those interested in programming in Swift and in contributing to the language itselfâ€”the Swift 3.0 retrospective focuses mostly on the benefits and drawbacks to going open source. Lattner describes the "vibrant community" as "fantastic," though he does note that open-source development "is slower and less predictable than 'closed design.'" Lattner says "the end result is significantly better, and therefore the tradeoff is worth it," even if "it is impossible to make everyone happy." The latter sentiment should ring true to anyone who has ever worked on any open source project.

Apple plans to release two major Swift updates between now and fall of 2017â€”Swift 3.1 in the spring and Swift 4.0 in the fall, along with whatever other minor bugfix releases are necessary.Â For Swift 4.0, Apple would like to focus on source and ABI stability first, and move on to other features once work on those two things is complete. After that, LattnerÂ outlines a number of goals that the team would like to accomplish if time permits:
<blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li>Reflection: The core team is committed to adding powerful dynamic features to Swift. For example, Swift 3 already added nearly all the infrastructure for data reflection (which is already used by the Xcode memory debugger). We should use this infrastructure to build out a powerful user-facing API. Similarly, we would like to design and build out the implementation for dynamic method reflection runtime + API support.</li>
 	<li>First class concurrency: Actors, async/await, atomicity, memory model, and related topics. This area is highly desired by everyone, as it will open the door for all sorts of new things on the client, server and more. We plan to start formal *discussions* about this in Phase 2, but it is unfortunately crystal clear that a new concurrency model wonâ€™t be done in time for the Swift 4 release. This is simply because it will take more than a 12 months to design and build, and we want to make sure to take time to do it right. It also makes sense for the memory ownership model to be better understood before taking this on.</li>
 	<li>Generics improvements: The <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md">generics manifesto</a> includes many exciting enhancements to the generics system, many of which will not be specifically required for ABI stability of the standard library, but would make Swift generics more powerful and expressive.</li>
 	<li>.swiftmodule stability: At some point we need to stabilize the â€œ.swiftmoduleâ€ binary file format (or replace it with a different mechanism) to allow 3rd party binary frameworks. This is a very large amount of work over and above what is required for ABI stability of the standard library.</li>
 	<li>New scripting features: Regular expressions, multi-line string literals, etc. Having these would make Swift much more appealing to the crowd doing scripting and those building web technologies, among others. Theyâ€™d also help round out the String model.</li>
 	<li>Property behaviors: This feature promises to provide powerful abstractions over the existing property model. The deferred <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0030-property-behavior-decls.md">SE-0030</a> proposal describes this opportunity well.</li>
 	<li>So many others: Submodules, implicit promotions between numeric types, importing C++ APIs, hygenic macro system, guaranteed tail calls, making enums enumerable, typed â€˜throwsâ€™, user defined attributes, abstract methods/classes, better SIMD support, â€˜dynamicâ€™ for non- at objc, data parallelism support, higher kinded types, â€¦</li>
 	<li>Syntactic sugar: I wonâ€™t list them all, but there are a ton of other trivial to small proposals that frequently come up, typically things seen in other languages that solve specific problems. These are the lowest priority to tackle for Swift 4.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Aside from those specific items, the note gives the casual observerÂ some insight into how Apple's open-source Swift efforts are going.

On the one hand, itâ€™s aimed at those who are not proficient in English so it seemed logical to write it in Russian. On the other hand, I also have many friends who are neither from Russia nor theyâ€™re native English speakers and so I can imagine that my thoughts here would also be interesting for them to go through. As you can see, I chose the latter. This blog post is about why I think itâ€™s very important for any software developer to know English on at least an intermediate level, both in terms of non-verbal (reading/writing) and verbal (speaking) types of communication.

<a class="anchor" name="s1"></a>
<h3>The way you manage yourself</h3>
I know many people (software developers) who are perfectly fine with not using English on a daily basis. They prefer books translated to their native languages (usually those are â€œhard copiesâ€ rather than e-books), they use localized software (for example, Russian Windows, Visual Studio, SQL Server, and so on), they receive global news from the national content aggregators and news portals, in case they need help online, they usually turn to domestic communities (localized documentation, Q&amp;A sites and forums, etc.), things like that. And itâ€™s perfectly fine, all this usually works quite well. But letâ€™s take a look at the disadvantages.

First, letâ€™s talk about translated books. The main problem with those (as I see it) is that it usually takes quite a lot of time before the translation hits the market. One of my friends recently bought the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/7259035/" target="_blank">translation</a> of Jon Skeetâ€™s <a href="http://www.manning.com/skeet2/" target="_blank">C# in Depth, second edition</a>whereas I (almost at the same time) bought <a href="http://www.manning.com/skeet3/" target="_blank">the third edition</a>. Iâ€™m not saying that the information from the second edition is way too old already, but letâ€™s face it: technology these days evolves so quickly that itâ€™s sometimes doesnâ€™t even make sense to publish a hard copy because by the time it sees the light, there will be so many changes and additions to the subject that it will require writing a new edition. Another problem with translations is that sometimes the translator doesnâ€™t have enough understanding of the subject in order to properly â€œprojectâ€ the knowledge into a new language (as an example, thereâ€™re quite a lot of complains regarding the translation quality of the second edition of C# in Depth).

Next is localized software. While I can understand why people are buying translated books, itâ€™s a complete mystery for me why software developers are installing localized copies of specialized software (for example, a .NET developer using a Russian version of Visual Studio). The biggest issue here is that itâ€™s often very hard to find a solution to a problem with particular tool or framework (for example, you get a weird .NET exception or the project build fails) if all you have is a bunch of localized error messages . The original documentation is always much better than any of its localizations plus resources like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> can really save you a lot of time as well as nerve cells.

The situation with news is similar to the one with books. News are useful when theyâ€™re fresh and although it doesnâ€™t take long to translate a single news article, things like the competence of the translator (same as with books) as well as the ability to consume the related information (for example, nobody translates comments, while they can provide a much better insight of the situation than the article itself) often make it more difficult to keep your hand on a pulse of technology.

<a class="anchor" name="s2"></a>
<h3>The way you represent yourself</h3>
Hereâ€™s something very important: <strong>your ability to express yourself in English can directly affect the ability of people around you to judge about your level of professional expertise</strong>. This is something I experienced personally as well as observed from the side. At my previous company we had a group of developers working remotely from Ukraine. Every now and then, we were having Skype meetings where we were planning next iterations, discussing current issues, etc. None of the Ukrainian guys had a particularly good verbal English and what I noticed is how my colleagues were communicating with them (not only via voice chat but also by email). It seemed that those Ukrainian guys were treated more like junior developers (basic stuff was always clarified, intense audit from the lead/manager was an ordinary thing, etc.) rather than developed professionals. The funny thing is that I knew what they were capable of doing since we could speak Russian to each other and I could tell that those guys had enough knowledge and experience in what they were doing. From my point of view it was their English that resulted in making a bad impression of themselves as professional developers. And itâ€™s not the only example, Iâ€™ve seen other cases like this.

Paul Graham recently <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57600831-76/y-combinators-paul-graham-defends-foreign-accent-comments/" target="_blank">made a remarkable statement</a> about one of the reasons they donâ€™t accept people to Y Combinator. He said literally the following: â€œOne quality thatâ€™s a really bad indication is a CEO with a strong foreign accent.â€. While thereâ€™re now many people who disagree with his statement (even those who spotted a racist tone in what he said), I think heâ€™s generally right. Why would I, as an investor, trust someone my money if that someone canâ€™t even properly pitch his idea so itâ€™s at least understood by everybody? I think that the same logic can be applied to software developers with a bad English: nobody is going to hire you as an architect or a team lead, if you canâ€™t even express your thoughts using a proper technical terminology.

<a class="anchor" name="s3"></a>
<h3>The way you act now</h3>
If you thought about yourself while reading the above, you know that you probably need to improve your English. Iâ€™m not going to suggest anything here because I think that thereâ€™re different techniques that work for different people. Someone learns better by watching movies with subtitles, by reading books with the dictionary and by playing video games (yes, a lot of people actually improve their foreign language skills by playing video games localized to that language). Others just take classes and receive knowledge from the teacher. If you have a possibility to communicate with the native speaker on a daily (weekly, monthly) basis, thatâ€™s great, that would probably help you a lot. Personally, I was just switching more and more to the English â€œcontentâ€ (uninstalling all localized software, switching from national news channels to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, etc.).

Good luck and take care!

I'm not the most adventurous eater, but I get a vicarious thrill out of watching people make things I would probably never try.

The other day I ended up watching a Pastry Chefs' Competition and it was mesmerizing. In these competitions, the chefs make huge sculptures out of melted sugar. They blow and twist the sugar like glass and dress it up with all sorts of decorations. Right before final judging they have to lift their delicate Rube Goldberg-esque sculptures off their work tables and carry them over to the judging table. Often they don't make it without a train wreck.. shattered sugar fins and gangly shapes everywhere. I haven't been reduced to hunting through the guide for Pastry Chefs' shows just to see the crashes, but it's tempting. I guess it is like watching auto racing, but knowing that no one will be hurt.

One other thing that I liked about the Pastry Chef's competition was the way that the chefs were judged. There was more to it than just the final judging. All during the preparation, judges walked from station to station with clipboards, making little notes. One of the criteria that they used was <i>working clean.</i> Imagine that.. working clean.. The judges were watching to make sure that the chefs rubbed clean every bowl and utensil immediately after use. If they didn't, well, they were marked off.

I've never worked in a professional kitchen, but I can see where <i>working clean</i> would be very important. If you wipe down a knife right after you use it, it's there, poised and ready for whatever you need to use it for next.

There's a great book out called <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> out by a chef named Tony Bourdain. In it, he describes what he calls the culinary underbelly of the restaurant business. Some of it is kind of scary, but some of it is kind of interesting.. you get a sense of what it is really like to be a line cook in a restaurant, and surprise surprise, it's nothing like what you might see on Emeril.

There's an section in the book where he talks about what cooks do late at night after the customers have gone home. They generally do what many people after work, they go out for beers and sit around talking about work, but what do they talk about really? Tony says that the subject that always comes up is something called <i>mis en place.</i> <i>Mis en place</i> is a blanket term for how you set up your station. Is your tub of butter at the eleven o'clock position or at the one o'clock? Do you have two paring knives, and do you keep them next to your cutting board or next to your garnish bin? When you spend the night churning out meals, these decisions make a difference. Everyone has their favorite theory about the proper <i>miz.</i> Tony says that many cooks get downright mystical about it. According Tony, you'd better run if you are caught messing with another cook's <i>miz.</i> Sharp knives have multiple uses, apparently.

I hate to draw comparisons between work in different professions, because often they miss, but I do think that we need these two concepts in software development: <i>working clean</i> and <i>mis en place</i>. Working clean, well there's a lot to say about that. We throw the term <i>refactoring</i> around a lot in the industry, but there's more to <i>working clean</i> than just refactoring. There's all of the <i>micro</i> work we do when we edit, and there's also the issue of what we do between editing sessions: what the code should look like over here before we stop and edit over there, for instance.

I think <i>mis en place</i> applies to us too, but not in a very straightforward way. If we wanted to form a direct analogy we'd say that our <i>miz</i> is our tools setup.. what our keyboard mappings are, what Eclipse plugins we use. But, I think that misses the point.. Cooks, well, the things they make go out the swinging doors; they seldom come back. In software development, most of our work happens in the context of code we've written before. To me, that means that our existing code is our <i>mis en place</i> and the way that it is structured really matters.

Personally, I think these things are part of the craft, and they are worthy of fevered discussion at the end of the day. I hope it happens on your team.

Welcome to <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>â€™s <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016">third interactive ranking</a> of the most popular programming languages. As itâ€™s impossible to look over the shoulder of every programmer, <em>Spectrum</em> uses various metrics as proxies for gauging the current use of a language. Working with data journalist <a href="http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/">Nick Diakopoulos,</a>from 10 online sources weâ€™ve chosen 12 metrics, each one of which gives insight along a different axis of popularity. Combining the metrics produces a single ranking.

Because each of you may value different thingsâ€”Whatâ€™s hot with the folks in open source? What are employers demanding?â€”<em>Spectrum</em>â€™s <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016">Interactive Top Programming Languages</a> lets you adjust the weight of each metric in contributing to the ranking. You also have the option to filter the results: for example, looking only at languages used in embedded systems or mobile applications. You can customize each weighting yourself or use one of our presets.

The default preset is intended to echo the interests of the average IEEE member. So what are <em>Spectrum</em>â€™s Top Ten Languages for 2016?

Staying in the top five, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> has swapped places with <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a> to take the No. 3 position, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx">C#</a> has fallen out of the top five to be replaced with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R.</a> R is following its momentum from previous years, as part of a positive trend in general for modern big-data languages that Diakopoulos <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-programming-languages-trends-the-rise-of-big-data">analyses in more detail here</a>.

Google and Apple are also making their presence felt, with Googleâ€™s <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> just beating out Appleâ€™s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a> for inclusion in the Top Ten. Still, Swiftâ€™s rise is impressive, as itâ€™s jumped five positions to 11th place since last year, when it first entered the rankings. Several other languages also debuted last year, a marked difference from this year, with no new languages entering the rankings.

<figcaption><strong>Explore the Interactive Rankings</strong></figcaption></figure></aside>Other notable changes include <a href="http://www.ladder-logic.com/hello-world/">Ladder Logic,</a> rising five positions to 34th place. Ladder Logic is used in programmable logic controllers, especially those used in factories. Although manufacturing may seem like a narrow niche for a language, its relative popularity indicates just how big that niche really is. <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/">HTML</a> also continues to be popular, rising to 16th place, despite the horror of some previous users of the Top Programming Languages that itâ€™s included at all (for the record, we take a pragmatic approach and define a programming language as a distinct syntax that is used to give a computer instructions, even if thoseÂ are just instructions on how data should be structured; Turing completeness is not required).

On the losing side, perhaps the most surprising is that Shell programmingâ€”a catchall term for the creation of scripts of the sort beloved by system administrators, using shells such as <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>â€”has declined in popularity, falling seven positions to 19th place. This may reflect the development of more sophisticated systems to manage cloud-based data centers, but weâ€™ll have to wait to see if the trend continues next year or if this is just a statistical fluke.

Itâ€™s usually fine to use something like <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000</code> (hey Rails!), or even <code>mysite.dev</code> as a custom entry in <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. But what if you need a dynamically changing domain names? Think of <code>*.dev</code>. Well, you can obviously keep adding more stuff to hosts file, but thatâ€™s a pretty big hassle. We need a DNS server!

About a year ago I found this nice little DNS server â€“ <a href="https://github.com/robbiev/devdns">devdns</a>. Itâ€™s written in Go and could be easily grabbed as a binary from github. Why devdns? I kind of liked the idea that it was designed to do only one thing â€“ respond with 127.0.0.1 to all type A queries and NXDOMAIN to any other query. Right after I found it I decided that having localhost hardcoded is not super useful, so I forked the repo and <a href="https://github.com/robbiev/devdns/pull/3">added the ability</a> to specify which IP address should be used by default.

How to use it? First, you might want to see how domain name resolves to an IP address:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">$ resolveip foobar.dev
resolveip: Unable to find hostid for 'foobar.dev': host not found</code></pre>
The error above indicates that we canâ€™t resolve the requested domain name. To make that happen, we will use OSXâ€™s resolver mechanism. Given that our desired domain is .dev, youâ€™ll need to create a resolver config file:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver
$ sudo nano /etc/resolver/dev</code></pre>
And specify contents for the dev file:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 5300</code></pre>
So now we just need to start the dns server:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">$ devdns 
2015/12/09 20:48:45 Listening on 127.0.0.1:5300, resolving to 127.0.0.1</code></pre>
And voila, it works!:

$ resolveip foobar.dev
IP address of foobar.dev is 127.0.0.1
Once you decide that you need to resolve the *.dev domains to another IP address, all you have to do is to restart local DNS server with the following flag:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup"># lets resolve all *.dev domains to docker-machine's VM
$ devdns -ip="192.168.99.100"</code></pre>
And now our domain name should resolve to a different IP address:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">$ resolveip foobar.dev
IP address of foobar.dev is 192.168.99.100</code></pre>

What goes into a good message? First, it needs to be short, and not just because brevity is the soul of wit. Most of the time, youâ€™ll be viewing commit messages in the context of Gitâ€™s commit log, where thereâ€™s often not a lot of space to display text.

Think of the commit log as a newsfeed for your project, in which the log message is the headline for each commit. Have you ever skimmed the headlines in a newspaper (or, for a more current example, BuzzFeed) and come away thinking youâ€™d gotten a summary of what was happening in the world? A good headline doesnâ€™t have to tell the whole story, but it should tell you enough to know what the story is about before you read it.

If youâ€™re working by yourself, or closely with one or two collaborators, the log may seem interesting just for historical purposes, because you would have been there for most of the commits. But in Git repositories with a lot of collaborators, the commit log can be more valuable as a way of knowing what happened when you werenâ€™t looking.

Commit messages can, strictly speaking, span multiple lines, and can be as long or as detailed as you want. Git doesnâ€™t place any hard limit on what goes into a commit message, and in fact, if a given commit does call for additional context, you can add additional paragraphs to a message, like so:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">Updated Ruby on Rails version because security

Bumped Rails version to 3.2.11 to fix JSON security bug. 
See also http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/1/8/Rails-3-2-11-3-1-10-3-0-19-and-2-3-15-have-been-released/
</code></pre>
Note that although this message contains a lot more context than just one line, the first line is important because only the first line will be shown in the log:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">commit f0c8f185e677026f0832a9c13ab72322773ad9cf
Author: David Demaree 
Date:   Sat Jan 3 15:49:03 2013 -0500

Updated Ruby on Rails version because security
</code></pre>
Like a good headline, the first line here summarizes the reason for the commit; the rest of the message goes into more detail.
<h3>Writing commit messages in your favorite text editor</h3>
Although the examples in this book all have you type your message inline, using the --message or -m argument to git commit, you may be more comfortable writing in your preferred text editor. Git integrates nicely with many popular editors, both on the command line (e.g., Vim, Emacs) or more modern, graphical apps like Atom, Sublime Text, or TextMate. With an editor configured, you can omit the --message flag and Git will hand off a draft commit message to that other program for authoring. When youâ€™re done, you can usually just close the window and Git will automatically pick up the message you entered.

To take advantage of this sweet integration, first youâ€™ll need to configure Git to use your editor (specifically, your editorâ€™s command-line program, if it has one). Here, Iâ€™m telling Git to hand off commit messages to Atom:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>$: git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"</code></pre>
Every text editor has a slightly different set of arguments or options to pass in to integrate nicely with Git. (As you can see here, we had to pass the --wait option to Atom to get it to work.) GitHubâ€™s help documentation has a good, <a href="http://bkaprt.com/gfh/05-05/">brief guide to setting up several popular editors.</a>
<h3>Elements of commit message style</h3>
There are few hard rules for crafting effective commit messagesâ€”just lots of guidelines and good practices, which, if you were to try to follow all of them all of the time, would quickly tie your mind in knots.

To ease the way, here are a few guidelines Iâ€™d recommend always following.
<h4>BE USEFUL</h4>
The purpose of a commit message is to summarize a change. But the purpose of summarizing a change is to help you and your team understand what is going on in your project. The information you put into a message, therefore, should be valuable and useful to the people who will read it.

As fun as it is to use the commit message space for cursingâ€”at a bug, or Git, or your own clumsinessâ€”avoid editorializing. Avoid the temptation to write a commit message like â€œAaaaahhh stupid bugs.â€ Instead, take a deep breath, grab a coffee or some herbal tea or do whatever you need to do to clear your head. Then write a message that describes what changed in the commit, as clearly and succinctly as you can.

In addition to a short, clear description, when a commit is relevant to some piece of information in another systemâ€”for instance, if it fixes a bug logged in your bug trackerâ€”itâ€™s also common to include the issue or bug number, like so:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>Replace jQuery onReady listener with plain JS; fixes #1357</code></pre>
Some bug trackers (including the one built into every GitHub project) can even be hooked into Git so that commit messages like this one will automatically mark the bug numbered 1357 as done as soon as the commit with this message is merged into master.
<h4>BE DETAILED (ENOUGH)</h4>
As a recovering software engineer, I understand the temptation to fill the commit messageâ€”and emails, and status reports, and stand-up meetingsâ€”with nerdy details. I love nerdy details. However, while some details are important for understanding a change, thereâ€™s almost always a more general reason for a change that can be explained more succinctly. Besides, thereâ€™s often not enough room to list every single detail about a change and still yield a commit log thatâ€™s easy to scan in a Terminal window. Finding simpler ways to describe something doesnâ€™t just make the changes youâ€™ve made more comprehensible to your teammates; itâ€™s also a great way to save space.

A good rule of thumb is to keep the â€œsubjectâ€ portion of your commit messages to one line, or about 70 characters. If there are important details worth including in the message, but that donâ€™t need to be in the subject line, remember you can still include them as a separate paragraph.
<h4>BE CONSISTENT</h4>
However you and your colleagues decide to write commit messages, your commit log will be more valuable if you all try to follow a similar set of rules. Commit messages are too short to require an elaborate style guide, but having a conversation to establish some conventions, or making a short wiki page with some examples of particularly good (or bad) commit messages, will help things run more smoothly.
<h4>USE THE ACTIVE VOICE</h4>
The commit log isnâ€™t a list of static things; itâ€™s a list of changes. Itâ€™s a list of actions you (or someone) have taken that have resulted in versions of your work. Although it may be tempting to use a commit message to label a version of the workâ€”â€œVersion 1.0,â€ â€œJan 24th deliverableâ€â€”there are other, better ways of doing that. Besides, itâ€™s all too easy to end up in an embarrassing situation like this:
<ul>
 	<li>Making the last homepage update before releasing the new site</li>
</ul>
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>$: git commit -m "Version 1.0"</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Ten minutes later, after discovering a typo in your CSS</li>
</ul>
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>$: git commit -m "Version 1.0 (really)"</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Forty minutes later, after discovering another typo</li>
</ul>
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>$: git commit -m "Version 1.0 (oh FFS)"</code></pre>
Describing changes is not only the most correct format for a commit message, but itâ€™s also one of the easiest rules to stick to. Rather than concern yourself with abstract questions like whether a given commit is the release version of a thing, you can focus on a much simpler story: I just did a thing, and this is the thing I just did.

Those â€œVersion 1.0â€ commits, therefore, could be described much more simply and accurately:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">$: git commit -m "Update homepage for launch"
$: git commit -m "Fix typo in screen.scss"
$: git commit -m "Fix misspelled name on about page"</code></pre>
I also recommend picking a tense and sticking with it, for consistencyâ€™s sake. I tend to use the imperative present tense to describe commits: Fix misspelled name on About page rather than fixed or fixing. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with fixed or fixing, except that theyâ€™re slightly longer. If another style works better for you or your team, go for itâ€”just try to go for it consistently.

What happens if your commit message style isnâ€™t consistent? Your Git repo will collapse into itself and all of your work will be ruined. Kidding! People are fallible, lapses will happen, and a little bit of nonsense in your logs is inevitable. Note, though, that following style rules like these gets easier the more practice you get. Aim to write the best commit messages you can, and your logs will be better and more valuable for it.

These simple questions make it easy to understand that there is no point in buying car insurance if
you donâ€™t have a car or if there are no car thieves in your town. They also highlight the poor value
in paying $10,000 per year to insure an $11,000 car unless you anticipate multiple thefts (in which
case, you might also consider moving to a different area).

Once we have a clear idea for an app, how do we start building the user interface?
<h1>Agenda</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>Present the concepts of Model-View-Controller, focusing on views and view controllers, and how they work together to presnet the UI of an iOS app.</li>
 	<li>With Interface Builder, use the Object Library (âŒ¥âŒ˜L) to add a Label for displaying the elapsed time, and change its contents to 00:00.0</li>
 	<li>Use the attributes Inspector() and Size Inspector to adjust the Label position, size, color and typeface.</li>
 	<li>Add constraints to the Label by Control-dragging upwards from the Label to the main view, add selecting Center Horizontally in Container to create a Center X Alignment constraint. Use the Pin tool to create a top Vertical Space constraint.</li>
 	<li>Resolve any constraint issue using the menu item Editor&gt; Resolve Auto Layout Issues &gt; Update Frames (Command + shift + =)</li>
 	<li>Use the Object Library (Command + Shift + L) again to add two Buttons, labeled Start and Stop, to the main view. Adjust their size and position with the Size Inspector (Command + Shift + 5).</li>
 	<li>Add a Center Y Aligment constraint to the Buttons by Control-dragging from the Start button to the Stop button, and select Center Y. Add a Vertical Space constraint by Control-dragging downward from the Start button to the main view, and selecting Bottom Space to Bottom Layout Guide.</li>
 	<li>Add Center X Aligment constraints to both buttons by select them both together(Command + Click), and using the Align tool to select Horizontal Center in Container and Use Current Canvas Value.</li>

By doing so, we are using a whole lot of different components that in total allow use to end up with a working app. Once our app runs, we will look under the hood in order to understand all those components and get a feeling for the inner workings of React Native applications. These insights form the basis that allows us to build more complex applications while truly understanding what we are doing.
<h2>Creating the app structure</h2>
Open a new Terminal window. On the command prompt, type the following and hit enter:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>react-native init HelloWorld</code></pre>
This result in some work being done which gives you a new folder named <code>HelloWord</code>. We will analyze its contents later - for now, we want to get our feet wet as quickly as possible.
<h2>Start the app</h2>
Start XcodeÂ®, choose <code>File â–¶ Openâ€¦</code> from the menu bar, navigate to the <code>HelloWorld</code> folder, and open
file <code>HelloWorld.xcodeproj.</code>
Then, choose <code>Product â–¶ Destination</code> from the menu bar, and from the list beneath <code>iOS Simulator,
</code>choose <code>iPhone 6.</code>
Now, hit <code>âŒ˜-R </code>in order to build and run the application. This will open two new windows: a terminal
window that talks about the <em>React packager,</em> and the iOS simulator which shows a visually rather
unimpressive app that greets you with a <code>Welcome to React Native! </code>message.
<blockquote>In case you get an ugly red error screen in the iOS Simulator that says Could not connect to
development server, then proceed as follows: - Switch to a Terminal window - cd to the root folder
of the Hello World project - Run npm start and keep the Terminal open</blockquote>
An awful lot of very interesting things just happened in order to display this simulator screen, and
dissecting all the components involved and analyzing all the ways these components interact with
each other will be a very exciting trip down the rabbit hole that is React Native - but, not yet. First
the doing, then the explanations.
<h2>Working on the Code</h2>
As said, a lot of different components are involved that make up our application, but front and
center is the JavaScript code that defines and manages the user interface of our app - after all, the
central idea behind React Native is the ability to write native apps with JavaScript. So letâ€™s look at
the JavaScript behind HelloWorld.
Fire up the editor or IDE you decided to use and point it at the HelloWorld folder you created. In it,
you will find a file named index.ios.js which you need to open in your editor.
<blockquote>In XcodeÂ®, you probably saw a file named main.jsbundle. For now, this is <strong>not</strong> what we are looking
for.</blockquote>
Itâ€™s immediately obvious that this is the file behind the UI we see in the simulator:
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">/**
 * Sample React Native App
 * https://github.com/facebook/react-native
 */
'use strict';
import React, {
  AppRegistry,
  Component,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View
} from 'react-native';

class HelloWord extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      
        
          Welcome to React Native!
        
        
          To get started, edit index.ios.js
        
        
          Press Cmd+R to reload,{'n'}
          Cmd+D or shake for dev menu
        
      
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#F5FCFF',
  },
  welcome: {
    fontSize: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
    margin: 10,
  },
  instructions: {
    textAlign: 'center',
    color: '#333333',
    marginBottom: 5,
  },
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('HelloWord', () =&gt; HelloWord);
</code></pre>
Clearly, this is JavaScript code, but if you havenâ€™t followed the latest developments in the JS world or if you did not yet play around with the â€œnormalâ€ React framework, then some parts of this code might look a bit odd. Not that this should stop us from fiddling around!
Change line 19 from
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>Welcome to React Native!</code></pre>
to
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>Howdy World</code></pre>
Then switch back to the iOS Simulator window and hit <strong>âŒ˜-R</strong>. The UI of our app will refresh and display the new text.
Now, if you heaven't done any native iOS app development before, hitting <em>Refresh</em> and seeing the changes you did to the code reflected in the Simulator probably doesn't feel like a big deal, but it actually is. The same procedure for an Objective-C or Swift based application involves a recompilation of the changed source code and a rebuild of the application that is then completely restarted in the Simulator. That doesn't only sound like it takes longer, it does take longer.
Once again, the explanation for why and how this "refresh" workflow actually works will follow later.
It would be great if we could make our app do something. Let's try to add a text input field for entering a name and change the behaviour of our app in a way that makes it greet the name we enter - if this doesn't secure us the #1 spot in Appstore charts, then I don't know what will.

What we need in order to achieve this functionality is:
a) An additional UI element plus styling that allows to input text
b) A function that handles the text that is input
c) A way to output the input text within the greet text element.
After that, the result should look like this:

In order to reach the point where we can actually start working on our first React Native application, some preparation is necessary.
On your development machine, the following components need to be made available:
<ul>
 	<li>Homebrew</li>
 	<li>io.js</li>
 	<li>Watchman</li>
 	<li>Google Chrome</li>
 	<li>React Native CLI</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing Homebrew</h3>
<em>Homebrew</em> is a package manager for Mac OSX. We will use it to subsequently install most of the software tools we need.
In order to install and set up Homebrew, open a Terminal shell window and run the following command:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code></pre>
For further information, visit the Homebrew homepage at <a href="http://brew.sh" target="_blank">http://brew.sh</a>
<h3>Installing io.js</h3>
<em>io.js</em> is a moderm fork of Node.js, the popular server-side JavaScript runtime enviroment. React Native ships with some helper tools that are written for io.js. Also, we will regularly use the Node.js/io.js package manager, <code>NPM</code>, to install the React Native command line tool and other dependencies
We are not going to install io.js directly. Instead, wee will use Homebrew to install nvm, the Node Version Manager.
<code>nvm</code> is a nifty little tool that takes the hassle out of managing parallel installs of different versions of Node.js and/or io.js. With it, you can install as many versions of Node.js and io.js as you wish, and quickly switch to the version you want to actually use for a given project.
In order to install and set up <code>nvm</code>, open a Terminal window and run the following command:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>brew install nvm</code></pre>
After install completed, create or open file $HOME/.bashrc, and add the following lines at the begining:
<pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code class="language-bash">export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh</code></pre>
Restart terminal and you now have <code>nvm</code> enabled in your Terminal session. Using nvm, we can now install io.js, follow this commands:
<pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code class="language-bash">nvm install iojs
nvm alias default iojs</code></pre>
This commands will install and setup the most recent stable version of io.js, plus the maching version of <code>npm</code>, the Node Package Manager, and make this setup the default.
<h3>Installing Watchman</h3>
React Native uses Watchman to monitor and react to changes in source code files. This is explained more detail in a next post.

In order to install and setup Watch man, open a Terminal window and run the following command:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>brew install --HEAD watchman</code></pre>
<h3>Install Google Chrome</h3>
Google Chrome isn't strictly necessary to create applications with React Native, but it allows to debug them during development. The details are explained in a next post.
Head over to <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Chrome Desktop</a> to download the latest version.
<h3>Install the React Native CLI</h3>
The React Native Command Line Interface (CLI) is a small io.js helper script that allows to setup new React Native projects.
In order to install and setup React Native CLI, open a Terminal window and run the following command:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>npm install -g react-native-cli</code></pre>
<em>(Sometimes we need use sudo for solve some permission error)</em>
With this, we are good to go to create our first application.
<blockquote>You might also want to install IDE. While Xcode is part of our development environment, it's certainly not the most well-suited JavaScript editor out there.

Given what Iâ€™ve been seeing in the industry and having used it myself, I stated that React had already won the client-side war. Fighting words like those need a bit more explaining, so here goes.

React is not just the hot new kid on the block, but a unifying paradigm. It can serve as a foundational technology for web applications that we can build on top of with confidence, knowing that it will not be replaced next month by its hotter cousin. Letâ€™s take a look at Reactâ€™s place among the current crop of MVC frameworks, exploring its strengths and ending with a prediction about where JavaScript development is headed in the future.

For the past few years many smart people have been trying to build the perfect framework for making single-page apps â€” applications rendered by JavaScript which have improved perceived performance by responding instantly to user input and data changes over time. Guillermo Rauchâ€™s article 7 Principles of Rich Web Applications is one of the best rationales for why this is important and the things we should consider when building them.

You can find examples of how these types of applications are built at TodoMVC, as the name suggests they have traditionally been made up of Models, Views and Controllers.

React enters from left of stage

When React was first announced it looked a little odd. It focused solely on the View layer, and had no Models or Controllers. The code examples were written in a strange syntax called JSX which appeared to many like a backwards step towards Yeâ€™ Olden Days where it was common to mix HTML and JavaScript together.

No information was given on how you should structure your application other than that of a component hierarchy â€” composable chunks of UI that could re-render efficiently whenever state changed. React took a few notable stances against popular ideas that existed in this space, features like two-way data binding and templating were blasted as bad ideas that are best avoided.

<h3>
Widespread Adoption</h3>

React quickly achieved critical mass. Itâ€™s hard to find JavaScript related mailing lists, conferences or meetups that donâ€™t mention React these days. All of the local development teams in my city seem to be adopting React and contrary to other popular frameworks the verdict seems unanimous â€” everyone who Iâ€™ve spoken with has touted the merits of one-way data flow, component hierarchies and simple explicit renders, making the task simpler and the code more predictable.

Reactâ€™s adoption has been surprising to me because of how volatile the JavaScript scene is. We rarely so broadly agree on anything. There are pockets of people loyal to one framework but most of us have jumped from framework to framework getting frustrated along the way with certain patterns that introduce complexity and bugs. I havenâ€™t yet heard of a single case of people moving away from React due to these frustrations, not since jQuery has it seemed like we have had such a clear winner out in front.

<h3>You Had One Job React, One Job.</h3>

Its focus on the view layer means that itâ€™s considerably less opinionated than other frameworks that attempt to solve every problem. Its wafer thin API means that thereâ€™s really not much to learn and it doesnâ€™t warrant more than a handful of pages of documentation. This is a great help to those learning and it makes development simpler too, as you donâ€™t have much cognitive overhead. Wherever possible, React opts for plain JavaScript constructs and language features rather than custom APIs or templating languages.

This design is also attractive to JavaScript developers who seem to favor focused utility libraries such as Underscore and Moment which do one thing well, very much the Unix philosophy. Doing one thing well has also allowed room for people interested in the project to contribute their own pieces to the React ecosystem. As a result of this projects like React Router, Redux and CSS Modules have arisen.

<h3>React Components Are Simple</h3>

Components are responsible for small isolated chunks of UI, they accept data and render consistently, every time. Front-end developers, back-end developers and designers can easily understand and contribute to components because they look like HTML and the minimal API footprint means that you can learn what you need to know about components in a day and start contributing right away.

<h3>Server Rendered HTML</h3>

React makes server-side rendering trivial because components can be thought of as functions that take data and return HTML. This design makes it easy to integrate server-side rendering into any server-side programming language or framework.

In the early days of client-side MVC we broke the web with things like hashbang routing and huge loading times before anything made its way to the screen. We also broke search engine crawlers by rendering everything with JavaScript when the page had loaded. Since then weâ€™ve learned from our mistakes and are taking these core tenets of the web seriously again â€” URLs, server rendered HTML and fast load times. React shines here where other frameworks have struggled.

<h3>DOM Updates Are Messy</h3>

Backbone was an important milestone for JavaScript. As the first and most prominent effort to bring MVC to the client-side, it showed us a new way that we could structure our applications. One of the first things it mentioned in its documentation is that itâ€™s a bad idea to maintain your state in the DOM. When the DOM remains the source of truth your app quickly becomes brittle and hard to follow. It becomes impossible to know which piece of code changed which element. Backbone encouraged an ideal of always re-rendering views based on the current state of the world, React enforces this same idea with itâ€™s pattern of one-way data flow.

React components donâ€™t define the transition between states. Instead, they explicitly render the view based on their current state, completely eliminating this task of manually tweaking the DOM. Its one-way data flow prevents the DOM from being the source of truth.

Admittedly, this makes certain tasks such as animation more difficult because those are cases where you do want to define transitions between states. For the vast majority of cases though, itâ€™s much simpler to only concern yourself with the final state of how the component should be rendered.

<h3>The Future</h3>

React will continue to grow in popularity and weâ€™ll see more supporting tools and projects. As the ecosystem around React matures, the library may change but the core ideas of one-way data flow, component hierarchies, explicit renders and virtual DOM reconciliation will live on.

React Native has shown how a simple view layer can be re-purposed to construct other types of UI as well. Thereâ€™s been a shift in the industry towards this pattern of building UIâ€™s and itâ€™s not going away any time soon.

In short, React has won and the future is bright.

As React has grown in popularity, the scale and complexity of the projects built with React has grown along with it. React is primarily a view layer library. This has caused some teams to hit unknown territory or limitations while building projects that require a different infrastructure. Facebook has been proactive in offering support and guidance during these growing pains.

<h3>Flux</h3>

One of the early growing pains for developers using React was event handling. Facebook responded to this issue by publishing Flux, which is an abstract pattern that encouraged unidirectional data flow for handling events in React.

Iâ€™ll assume some familiarity with Flux, so I wonâ€™t discuss the details of it in this article. In case you arenâ€™t familiar with this topic, you can give a reading to this article by Sandeep Panda or take a look at this page about Flux.

Flux has taken the React ecosystem to the next level. As developers started to get more familiar with Flux, some issues emerged. Flux has been great for managing data as application state, but populating the initial state into an application has been a source of friction.

There are several challenges surrounding Fluxâ€™s data initialization. Do stores call the server and populate themselves? Do we use rehydrate methods from the dispatcher? Do we call a bunch of actions on the server to populate the stores? How do we do this asynchronously and load all our data on the server in an isomorphic app before returning a response?

<h2>What Is Relay?</h2>

Relay is a new React Data fetching framework published by Facebook. Relay aims to provide a clear solution to all of these data-fetching problems.

Relay has a few main selling points:

<ul>
    <li>Declarative: This is also a main feature of React. Relay leverage a declarative code style definition for data dependencies, which is very similar to how view components are defined. This is a refreshing change from traditional imperative data-fetching APIs.</li>

    <li>Collocation: Data dependency definitions live alongside component definitions, which makes it much easier to reason about what data a UI component requires to render. This makes troubleshooting a projectâ€™s code a lot easier. Looking at a file that contains a React component definition, itâ€™s immediately obvious what data it needs to function.</li>

    <li>Mutations: Mutations enable an experience of seamless modification to data which a React view is subscribed to and also populates those modifications to the data persistence layer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Relay vs Flux</h3>

Flux is an abstract idea whereas Relay is an implementation inspired by that idea. Relay is built on the concepts of Flux and has the same concepts of dispatcher, actions, and stores, but they are represented a bit differently. Relay has a new concept called â€˜Higher Order Componentsâ€™ and weâ€™ll expand on this topic in the remainder of the article.

At this stage, itâ€™s still unclear if Relay will replace or coincide with existing Flux implementations. For example, Redux, a popular Flux implementation, also leverage â€˜Higher Order Componentsâ€™. Trying to use both Redux and Relay will cause a conflict over which framework is bound to a UI component. There is currently an ongoing discussion regarding Reduxâ€™s relationship with Relay.

<h2>Higher Order Components</h2>

Higher Order components or HOCs are defined in the same way as regular React components. HOCs wrap child UI components. The HOC will execute its queries and then render the child UI component, passing the query data in as props. The Flux flow is now managed by the HOC and the latter will act as a dispatcher. It has methods like setQueryParams() that can be considered as a Flux action. Calling <code>setQueryParams()</code> triggers the Flux flow. The queries defined in the HOC are updated, new data is fetched and the data is persisted in the HOC. The HOC is acting as a Flux store by persisting this data.

Below is a simplified example of a ProfilePicture component and a complimentary HOC. Imagine that we have ProfilePicture defined to render user avatars throughout our project. We need to fetch the data to display the user avatar. We then create a Relay HOC to query the user profile pictures from a database. The HOC passes this query data to the child ProfilePicture component:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>class ProfilePicture extends React.Component {
  // A standard Profile Picture component
}

// This is our Higher Order Component. It fetches the data to pass
// as props to Profile Picture
module.exports = Relay.createContainer(ProfilePicture, {
  fragments: {
    user: () => Relay.QL`
      fragment on User {
        profilePicture(size: $size) {
          uri,
        },
      }
    `,
  },
});</code></pre>

Our ProfilePicture component will then get some new local functions passed in as props. This essentially is how Relay triggers the Flux flow. The component calls these Relay prop functions, which is equivalent to a Flux action call. This causes Relay to fetch the latest data requested. Once done it populates its internal store and passes that down to the HOCâ€™s child view component as props.

<h2>GraphQL</h2>

The above example may look a bit strange, particularly this part:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>Relay.QL`
      fragment on User {
        profilePicture(size: $size) {
          uri,
        },
      }
    `,</code></pre>

Much of the magic behind Relay is powered by GraphQL. GraphQL is a new query language from Facebook that specializes in operating on graph data structures. Discussing GraphQL in depth is outside the scope of this article, however you can deepen this topic by reading the Relay documentation which covers it. An existing project will not be set up to work with GraphQL right out of the box. The first recommended steps to getting started with Relay are:

<ul>
<li>Create a GraphQL Schema</li>
<li>Create a GraphQL Server</li>
</ul>

It should be noted that it may take a considerable amount of work to convert an existing project to a GraphQL Schema and set up or modify an existing server to be GraphQL-friendly. When starting a project from scratch, it might make more sense to use Relay immediately. Facebook provides a Relay Starter Kit that looks like a great solution for getting up and running with Relay and GraphQL on a new project.

<h2>Relay Without GraphQL</h2>

With all of the extra overhead required to set up GraphQL, Facebookâ€™s Relay might not be the right tool for existing projects. Luckily, there is another Relay-inspired library out there that may be a better fit for these projects called react-transmit. react-transmit is an open source project that aims to be a â€œRelay-inspired library based on Promises instead of GraphQL.â€

If we update the profile example from above to use react-trasmit then we have the following code:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>// Import Transmit
import Transmit from "react-transmit";

class ProfilePicture extends React.Component {
  // A standard Profile Picture component
}

// This is our Higher Order Component. It fetches the data to pass
// as props to Profile Picture
Transmit.createContainer(ProfilePicture, {
  fragments: {
    user: (userId) => {
      return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { 
          // Do some Ajax here and resolve the promise
      });
    }
  },
});</code></pre>

The react-transmit example looks very similar to the Relay example. However, in this instance the user fragment is now a function that returns a Promise instead of a GraphQL query.

<h2>Current State of Relay</h2>

Facebook has released an open source â€œtechnical previewâ€ of Relay. They have some great examples in the repository that show how to work with Relay and a very detailed documentation section.

It doesnâ€™t seem that Relay is suitable for isomorphic applications at this time. There is no way to tell Relay to wait until all of the data dependencies have been loaded before rendering its child view, something that is needed on the server. In case youâ€™re interested, there is an ongoing discussion regarding how Relay will work on the server. At the moment, this is a pattern that react-transmit is more suited to at the current time.

As for Relayâ€™s future, its roadmap aims to provide a few key features soon:

Adapters for other data storage types so there is no hard dependency on GraphQL.
Better isomorphic support, as discussed earlier.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

In this article, weâ€™ve discussed a new React complementary framework called Relay. Relay is built on some of the same concepts of Flux and powered by GraphQL. As I mentioned, Relay might not be a good choice for already existing projects. However, this framework is quite new and I expect it to become better and better at every release.

Now, itâ€™s your turn. Did you know Relay?

While reading through the React examples, it really does look similar to Node.js.

Like Node.js, youâ€™re encouraged to write your applications to execute asynchronously. For those who may not be familiar with asynchronous programming, the server answers requests with a single thread but uses worker threads for time-consuming tasks like writing to a file, reading from a database, retrieving results from the Twitter API, etc. When the task is finished, the worker returns the result to the main thread which finalizes the request. This style of programming can give an enormous speed boost.
<h3>Getting React</h3>
React is available with Composer through Packagist (if youâ€™re not familiar with working with Composer, check out my previous article). To install React, create a new composer.json file with the following content:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">{
  "require": {
    "react/react": "0.2.*"
  }
}</code></pre>
Open a console, navigate to where the file is, and run php composer install. React and its dependencies will be retrieved and can then be used by including the <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> file.
<h3>Creating a Simple Server</h3>
With Node.js you create a server script yourself instead of using a server application like Apache or Nginx. You set up an event function, define a port which your server will listen to, and then wait for requests. With each request the event function is executed. This is the same in React.

This example is taken from the the React projectâ€™s README.md file:
<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">&lt;?php require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; $i = 0; $app = function ($request, $response) use (&amp;$i) { $i++; $text = "This is request number $i.n"; $headers = array('Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain');

    $response-&gt;writeHead(200, $headers);
    $response-&gt;end($text);
};

$loop = ReactEventLoopFactory::create();
$socket = new ReactSocketServer($loop);
$http = new ReactHttpServer($socket);

$http-&gt;on('request', $app);

$socket-&gt;listen(1337);
$loop-&gt;run();</code></pre>
First it includes the Composer autoloader file, and then sets the variable $i to zero which will be used to count the requests. Then, something that is not an overly common practice in the PHP community, our event function which will handle all incoming requests is stored to a variable. The function sets the responseâ€™s headers and prints the number of handled requests.

The script creates an event loop that handles unblocked I/O for us, a socket, and then the server. Finally, the event function is assigned, the socket is set to listen on port 1337, and the event loop is run.

If you save the code as server.php and run it from the command line with php server.php, and then navigate your browser to http://localhost:1337, youâ€™ll see the response. Donâ€™t forget to check your command line to see how many requests have been handled!
<h3>Exploring React Further</h3>
React can do much more than act as an HTTP server. We can use it for some much cooler things. Think of this example: youâ€™re a spy for the CIA and you want to transfer data to your boss. The boss creates a server, you connect as a client via a socket, and everything you type is then logged in the serverâ€™s log.

Support for sockets is handled by the socket component in React, and for this example you donâ€™t need the full React library. The following composer.json should be sufficient:
<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code class="language-markup">{
  "require": {
    "react/socket": "0.2.*"
  }
}</code></pre>
And this is the example code:
<pre class="line-numbers language-php"><code class="language-php">&lt;?php require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; $loop = ReactEventLoopFactory::create(); $socket = new ReactSocketServer($loop); $socket-&gt;on('connection', function ($conn) use ($loop) {
  $conn-&gt;write("Successfully connected to the writing servern");
  echo 'client connected';
  $dataStream = new ReactStreamStream(fopen('data.txt', 'w'), $loop);

  $conn-&gt;on('data', function($data) use ($conn, $dataStream) {
    $dataStream-&gt;write($data);
  });

  $conn-&gt;on('end', function() {
    echo 'connection closed';
  });
});

$socket-&gt;listen(4000);
$loop-&gt;run();</code></pre>
We create an event loop again and then create a socket. When the connection event is emitted, we print a message to the console. We create a new writing stream and name it $dataStream and when we receive data, we push it down the stream and the data will be written to our file. When the client disconnects, the stream is closed.

After running php server.php you can connect by using nc localhost 4000. Everything you type and press enter afterwards is logged to data.txt.
<h3>Who Would Use React?</h3>
So React offers some really awesome functionality, but why would you use a younger library thatâ€™s not yet stable instead the more mature Node.js, which also has a big community? I was thinking this myself, so I asked Igor Wiedler:

I wouldnâ€™t really recommend running react in production at this point. Some of the lower level parts are quite stable, the higher level stuff not so much. The target audience right now is people who like to experiment with cutting-edge technologies and arenâ€™t afraid to debug stuff when it breaks. I particular: Iâ€™m interested in having new libraries based on the react event loop, so that they can be used together.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Is React an interesting project? I think so, even if it just ports Node.jsâ€™ functionality, it does so in a cool way, and who would have thought that it was even possible to do such things in PHP? At least I didnâ€™t.

React seems like a promising project, even while itâ€™s not production-ready yet, it seems to have some cool features and a good developer to maintain it. Of course I canâ€™t explain every aspect of React in this short article, so if you want to learn more about React:";s:10:"post_title";s:21:"A First Look at React";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"a-first-look-at-react";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-08-01 08:51:33";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-08-01 08:51:33";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"http://scriptsvn.com/?p=355";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"6";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:31;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"350";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2016-02-22 16:14:18";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2016-02-22 16:14:18";s:12:"post_content";s:7160:"A â€˜Bounce Rateâ€˜ is simply the percentage of users who visit your site and then navigate away after viewing just a single page.

You can make use of Google Analytics to determine the bounce rate of your site and therefore the percentage of users that are actually clicking away from your site after viewing only one page.

Bounce rate is an important consideration, not only in terms of user engagement and experience, but also SEO. If youâ€™re interested in the bounce rate from an SEO perspective, then itâ€™s worth also having a read of The Top WordPress SEO Plugins Reviewed.

Bounce rate is a serious issue for many sites, but there are effective methods which can be employed to reduce it. Below, Iâ€™ll show you how to reduce bounce rate on your WordPress site with methods that really work.

<h2>Reducing Bounce Rate</h2>

<a href="https://scriptsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1455900640Bounce-Rate-1024x327.png" rel="attachment wp-att-351"><img src="http://scriptsvn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1455900640Bounce-Rate-1024x327.png" alt="1455900640Bounce-Rate-1024x327"  class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-351" /></a>
Bounce Rate

<h3>1. Increase Site Speed</h3>

Internet users are becoming less tolerant of slow loading sites all of the time. A report by Sean Work shows that 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less, 40% of people abandon a website that takes more than 3 seconds to load, a one second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions, and that if an e-commerce site is making $100,000 per day, a one second page delay could potentially cost it $2.5 million in lost sales every year.

If you are the only provider of a specific service or type of content, and you donâ€™t particularly care about the user-experience youâ€™re providing, then you might consider ignoring your site loading speed. Otherwise, speed up your site as much as you can and donâ€™t expect users to sit around waiting for your site to complete loading (they actually wonâ€™t) if sluggish.

See my article on 12 Ways to Speed up Your WordPress Website for more information.

<h3>2. Provide Quality Content</h3>

Provision of quality content is no doubt the most crucial factor when it comes to the success of a site. Providing poor content will not only increase the bounce rate on your site, but will also make you lose the trust and confidence in your users.

When users visit a site and canâ€™t get what they want, they leave and search for other places to get it, and they tend not to return.

<h3>3. Long Articles Should be Split Into Parts</h3>

People tend to be time-poor and want concise, informative articles without unnecessary padding and irrelevant information. Give them what they want, in a form that can be quickly and easily understood and they will stay around and take more interest in your content.

<h3>4. You Donâ€™t Have to Use Pop Ups</h3>

Pop-ups may increase subscription rates and conversions but they also run a high risk of annoying people. I myself immediately close a pop-up and navigate away from a site if I come across one.

There are plenty of alternative ways of presenting call to actions, perhaps a short announcement or subscription widget. You can also conduct A/B split testing to see what works best for your site.

<h3>5. Improve Siteâ€™s Mobile Responsiveness</h3>

With a rapidly growing number of visitors accessing the web via smartphones and tablets, you should really prepare your WordPress site to work just perfectly on small screen sizes.

This shouldnâ€™t be a problem, as you can easily handle this by choosing themes that are responsive. If you canâ€™t afford a paid responsive theme, trust me, youâ€™ll find hundreds of free themes that are responsive. Check out this recent post by Tahir Taous which covers 10 of the Most Popular Free WordPress Themes.

<h3>6. External Links Should Be Opened in a New Tab</h3>

You donâ€™t really want to send visitors away with your own links right? So when making reference to resources outside your site, you should ensure they really see the resources â€œoutsideâ€ your site.

One method that is commonly used is to set the target attribute in links to _blank, this will ensure users are redirected to a new tab when they click on the links, instead of opening the link in the same page with your site. This method is often the subject of hot debate, but itâ€™s something a lot of people do.

<pre class="line-numbers language-php"><code><a href="https://link_here" target="_blank"> Some text here </a></code></pre>

<h3>7. Site Design and User Experience</h3>

Letâ€™s imagine we open a site with the goal of reading a post or checking out their services and as we land on the site weâ€™re welcomed with a completely yellow background, red text, and a header high enough to house your photo album.

If youâ€™re like me, then you wonâ€™t think twice before navigating away from the site.

Site design is a very crucial element that should be well taken care of. Even if your content is not perfect, trust me, if your site is clean and pleasing, you might encourage users to stick around and check out other pages on your website.

<h3>8. Link to Internal Content and Show Related Posts</h3>

This is no doubt a good way to keep users on your site. Rather than linking to external resources all the time, referring to the ones you have on your site is good.

When users finish reading a post on your site, what do they do next? Stick around or go back to where they came from? Even though great content encourages users to read more, you have to make it as simple as possible, especially when they are interested in staying.

A plugin like YARRP will help achieve this goal without any stress.

<h3>9. Handle Ads Wisely</h3>

I understand you have to generate some revenue from your site, but if you donâ€™t do this wisely, you might be losing in two ways: reduction in revenue and reduction in the amount of users and their time onsite.

You donâ€™t really want to make visitors wonder what is an ad and what is the real content. Retain just a very few ads on your homepage, or better still if possible have none. On your post pages, arrange the ads the best way you can, text ads would be perfect.

<h3>10. Provide Clear Navigation</h3>

Assuming you build your business website using WordPress, creating clear and understandable navigation in the header area is ideal. If you canâ€™t provide a clear path through your site for users, theyâ€™ll leave and go somewhere else.

For example, when users are only interested in seeing your portfolio to decide if youâ€™d be great to work with, implementing a bad navigation system will have them searching for other alternatives in no time.

Make sure your navigation is clear and easy to access, understandable and not confusing.

In case you haven't read our previous benchmarks article, here is what we did: we took a sample implementation of DBMonster along with the excellent benchmark scripts and tools from this post, reimplemented it for use with different DOM libraries, ran the scripts and collected the results. For this post we have also extended browser-perf to generate memory usage statistics.

We will submit our additions to browser-perf for review, which is why we haven't linked to the original browser-perf repo above.
What follows is an overview of the contenders. Or you can jump straight to the results.

<h3>Angular.js 1.x</h3>

The venerable Angular 1.x library is part of an opinionated but powerful framework that saw its initial release in the year 2009. Since then it has gathered a tremendous following and inspired many other libraries. Often criticized for being hard to integrate into existing projects, and questioned for its performance in certain use cases, it is still used in many high-ranking websites. Angular extends standard HTML with custom tags and a template syntax (which form the view). Controllers are defined following a series of strict API requirements that include the use of dependency injection. Data binding and model changes are handled through a digest cycle. The digest cycle is the method Angular uses to detect changes in the model that trigger changes in the view. This method has particular performance characteristics as can be seen in the results below.

<h3>An Angular 1.x view template:</h3>

<pre class="line-numbers language-php"><code class='language-php'><td ng-repeat="query in database.topFiveQueries"
    ng-class="getClassName(query)">

    <div class="popover left">
        <div class="popover-content">

        </div>
        <div class="arrow"></div>
    </div>
</td></code></pre>

And part of the associated JavaScript code, including dependency injection semantics:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>dbmonControllers.controller('MainController', ['$scope', '$timeout',
    function($scope, $timeout) {
        $scope.loadCount = 0;
        $scope.databases = {};

        $scope.getClassName = function(query) {
            var className = "elapsed short";
            if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
                className = "elapsed warn_long";
            } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
                className = "elapsed warn";
            }
            return "Query " + className;
        };
        //(...)
    }
);</code></pre>

<h3>Angular.js 2</h3>

The still-in-flux Angular 2 library has recently been declared in beta state. Still under heavy scrutiny by many developers that do not consider a breaking change to be the right way to fix all of Angular 1.x problems, Angular 2 carries on with its opinionated approach. TypeScript is now favored (but not required) over JavaScript and a new template syntax is now required. The digest cycle was replaced by the use of a change detection algorithm that walks the DOM tree. Other optimizations allow Angular 2 to detect precisely when the model has changed (in contrast to the need to explicitly tell Angular 1 so in certain cases).

<h3>An Angular 2 view template:</h3>

<pre class="line-numbers language-php"><code class='language-php'><td *ngFor="#query of database.topFiveQueries"
    [ngClass]="getClassName(query)">

    <div class="popover left">
        <div class="popover-content">

        </div>
        <div class="arrow"></div>
    </div>
</td></code></pre>

And its associated JavaScript code:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>app.AppComponent = ng.core
    .Component({
      selector: 'my-app',
      templateUrl: './app/component.html'
      //directives: [angular.NgFor]
    })
    .Class({
        //(...)
        getClassName: function(query) {
            var className = "elapsed short";
            if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
                className = "elapsed warn_long";
            } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
                className = "elapsed warn";
            }
            return "Query " + className;
        }
    ]);</code></pre>

Our Angular 2 DBMonster code was developed using JavaScript rather than the recommended TypeScript to reuse as much code as possible from other versions of the benchmark. Angular 2 code is more idiomatic using TypeScript and was developed with its features in mind.

<h2><h3>Virtual DOM</h3></h2>

Virtual DOM is an independent implementation of React's tree-diffing algorithm. It provides an API that allows users to describe a DOM tree directly in JavaScript. JSX is not used.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>function renderQuery(query) {
    var className = "elapsed short";
    if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn_long";
    } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn";
    }

    return h('td', { className: 'Query ' + className }, [
        query.elapsed ? formatElapsed(query.elapsed) : '',
        h('div', { className: 'popover left' }, [
            h('div', { className: 'popover-content' }, query.query),
            h('div', { className: 'arrow' })
        ])
    ]);
}</code></pre>

<h3>Mithril.js</h3>

A React-like library aimed at being simple, small and fast. It provides a convenient API to describe DOM-trees in JavaScript, and a preprocessor to turn DOM-tree API-calls into simple JSON objects for additional speed. The API for DOM-trees is similar to that of Virtual DOM, and the required controller/view objects are simple enough to be integrated easily into existing bodies of code. Much like Angular 1, it requires changes to the DOM tree made outside library boundaries to be notified for redrawing. Data-binding is performed through a properties system.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>function renderQuery(query) {
    var className = "elapsed short";
    if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn_long";
    } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn";
    }

    return m('td', { className: 'Query ' + className }, [
        query.elapsed ? formatElapsed(query.elapsed) : '',
        m('div', { className: 'popover left' }, [
            m('div', { className: 'popover-content' }, query.query),
            m('div', { className: 'arrow' })
        ])
    ]);
}</code></pre>

<h3>cito.js</h3>

A minimalist Virtual DOM-like library. A virtual DOM is constructed from plain JSON-like objects. A simple call tells the library to compare the existing tree to a new one and perform the necessary updates.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>function renderQuery(query) {
    var className = "elapsed short";
    if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn_long";
    } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn";
    }

    return {
        tag: 'td',
        attrs: { 'class': 'Query ' + className },
        children: [
            query.elapsed ? formatElapsed(query.elapsed) : '',
            {
                tag: 'div',
                attrs: { 'class': 'popover left' },
                children: [
                    {
                        tag: 'div',
                        attrs: { 'class': 'popover-content' },
                        children: query.query.toString()
                    }, {
                        tag: 'div',
                        attrs: { 'class': 'arrow' }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    };
}</code></pre>

<h3>Ember 1</h3>

Another powerful and opinionated framework. Ember makes use of their own template language which allows for easy differentiation between static and dynamic parts of the DOM. Their diffing algorithm is optimized to take this into account. Data binding is handled through a properties system.

An Ember view using its template syntax:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>
  <td class="Query ">

    <div class="popover left">
      <div class="popover-content"></div>
      <div class="arrow"></div>
    </div>
  </td></code></pre>

And its associated JavaScript code:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>export default Ember.Component.extend({
  tagName: 'tr',

  queries: function() {
    var samples = this.get('attrs.db.value.samples');
    return samples[samples.length - 1].queries;
  }.property('attrs.db'),

  topFiveQueries: function() {
    var queries = this.get('queries');
    var topFiveQueries = queries.slice(0, 5);

    while (topFiveQueries.length < 5) {
      topFiveQueries.push({ query: "" });
    }

    return topFiveQueries.map(function(query, index) {
      return {
        key: index+'',
        query: query.query,
        elapsed: query.elapsed ? formatElapsed(query.elapsed) : '',
        className: elapsedClass(query.elapsed)
      };
    });
  }.property('queries'),

  //(...)
});</code></pre>

<h3>Ember 2</h3>

This newer version of Ember removes many deprecated parts of the library and serves as a cleanup of the API. Most of the other benefits of Ember 2 can also be found in Ember 1.13+ releases.

The Ember 2 code in this article is 100% compatible with the Ember 1.x version, so no example is provided here.

<h3>React.js</h3>

Facebook's popular library is gaining ground day-by-day. Its simple integration model, flexibility and speed make it a no-brainer for many projects. The crux of React is its smart diffing algorithm: a virtual tree is constructed by making JavaScript calls. When a new DOM tree is constructed, React can find the optimal number of operations to transform the old tree into the new one. React is usually paired with the JSX preprocessor, which allows an extended form of HTML to be embedded in JavaScript to describe components in a convenient way.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>var Query = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    var className = "elapsed short";
    if (this.props.elapsed >= 10.0) {
      className = "elapsed warn_long";
    }
    else if (this.props.elapsed >= 1.0) {
      className = "elapsed warn";
    }

    return (
      <td className={"Query " + className}>
        {this.props.elapsed ? formatElapsed(this.props.elapsed) : ''}
        <div className="popover left">
          <div className="popover-content">{this.props.query}</div>
          <div className="arrow"/>
        </div>
      </td>
    );
  }
})</code></pre>

<h3>Incremental DOM</h3>

A Google project, Incremental DOM aims to develop a memory-efficient library that can perform in-place updates of the DOM tree. It is intended to be used as a compilation target for different template languages. In practice, its API is similar to that of Virtual DOM, Mithril or cito.js. The main benefit of a memory efficient approach is reduced waits during garbage collection cycles. This can result in improved performance and fewer dropped frames during rendering.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>function renderQuery(query) {
    var className = "elapsed short";
    if (query.elapsed >= 10.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn_long";
    } else if (query.elapsed >= 1.0) {
        className = "elapsed warn";
    }

    elementOpen('td', null, null, 'class', "Query " + className);
        text(query.elapsed ? formatElapsed(query.elapsed) : '');
        elementOpen('div', null, ['class', 'popover left']);
            elementOpen('div', null, ['class', 'popover-content']);
                text(query.query);
            elementClose('div');
            elementVoid('div', null, ['class', 'arrow']);
        elementClose('div');
    elementClose('td');
}</code></pre>

<h2>The Results</h2>

Here are the summarized results of our tests:

Major GC collection times Angular 1.x results make this graph hard to read. Angular 1.x performance problems are known and it shows in this graph. Major GC collections take several times longer compared to the alternatives. As expected, lightweight libraries such as mithril and cito.js shine here, but the absolute winner is Virtual DOM. Incremental DOM is also among the winners. The difference between Angular 1 and 2 is outstanding. It appears a big break was necessary to fix many of the shortcomings Angular 1 had.

Minor GC collection times Incremental DOM shines here. Being developed for lower memory use pays off. React is a surprise as well, sporting excellent results in spite of its two-copies virtual DOM algorithm. The one that draws the attention is Virtual DOM, with its independent React-like virtual dom implementation: it shows longer pauses that React. This is probably the result of the optimizations Facebook developers have done over time to React. Angular 1.x is still the slowest and the difference with Angular 2 is still surprising. Ember 1 and 2 are the next in the pack in front of Angular 1. The difference between Ember 1 and 2 is significant. It appears many optimizations have been carried out under the hood.

Layout times This graph shows the time spent by the browser doing re-layout operations (i.e. creating an internal representation of the DOM tree after changes). I find it surprising that cito.js is the slowest in this case. Subjective performance would tell otherwise, as both cito.js and Incremental DOM feel quite snappy when interacting directly with the browser. Ember 1 and 2 are the next in the pack, and in this case the subjective feeling matches with the result. React is black-magic in this case, being the fastest. Incremental DOM sits somewhere in the middle along with the rest.

Paint times This graph is almost a copy of the previous one. It shows the amount of time spent rasterizing the elements in the internal DOM tree of the browser. There is not much to add here other than restate that the subjective feeling for Incremental DOM and cito.js does not match what is shown in the graph (really, try it!).

FPS Deviation among most libraries is small in this graph, so one would expect hands-on usage to be pretty much the same for all of them except one (Angular 1). This is not the case. Even though Angular 1.x does feel sluggish compared to the pack, the difference between cito.js and Incremental DOM compared to the others is much bigger than it would appear. There must be something else going on behind the scenes (or this metric is either not measured correctly or useless).

Dropped frame counts This chart shows the number of frames that take longer than 16.6ms to be drawn. They account for stuttering and other non-smooth behavior so it is an important metric for the subjective feeling of an application. Ember 1 and 2 are outshined by almost all of the other libraries. Incremental DOM, on the other hand, shines again, followed closely by Mithril and React. Again the results for cito.js are odd. We will review our testing environment to make sure background processes are not affecting these results.

Total JavaScript execution times This graph shows the total amount of time spent by the browser executing JavaScript code. Ember 1 and 2 are the slowest here, followed closely by Angular 1.x. Again the difference between Angular 1 and 2 is abysmal. In my limited experience with Angular 2, I would say it is a step in the right direction. Incremental DOM and React shine here, followed closely by Mithril and Virtual DOM. If it serves as any indication, when it comes to CPU metrics, React appears to be the most balanced, scoring wins and near wins in several benchmarks.

Max heap size Average heap use These two graphs are deeply related so there is only one paragraph for both of them. Both show the amount of memory used by the browser when running the benchmark. The first one shows the maximum size of the heap, including unused free space; while the second shows an average of the amount of memory used only by active objects. They look mostly the same. In general, Incremental DOM used the least amount of memory, followed closely by React (a real surprise!). React optimizations have paid off and it still looks as all-around balanced library. Mithril, cito.js and Virtual DOM all do very well in these tests. Again, of note are the improvements when going from Angular 1 to Angular 2. Angular 2 has improved every single metric when compared to Angular 1, and in a significant way. Angular 1 almost doubles the memory use of its follower.

Check out the full code for all tests.

<h3>Aside: React at Auth0</h3>

At Auth0 we care about maintainability and performance. We routinely look at competing solutions to find out the right tool for the job. For our Passwordless Lock library, we found that React has great performance characteristics, allows for an easy integration path, and results in clean, readable code. At the same time, it sports an active community that allows our developers to quickly and easily find how to get the job done. If you are interested in seeing how we use React, check out the source!

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

We are consistently surprised by the results of the Incremental DOM library. Not only in numbers, but also in the way it feels faster than the alternatives. Google has done a tremendous job optimizing its internals to produce a faster and leaner library. The only other library the has achieved this subjective feeling of speed is cito.js. In the case of cito.js we are concerned by its apparent lack of development activity at GitHub. When it comes to bigger frameworks, we cannot recommend React enough. It sports the right balance of performance, memory use, support and community mindshare. Mithril.js surprised us with its ease of use and great performance. We consider it to be a rightful contender to React, with an all-around great balance between speed, memory usage and ease of use. Between the bigger frameworks, both Angular and Ember are good choices. We consider them great for many use cases: in particular, for developers that adhere to their specific ideologies (if you like TypeScript, you will love Angular 2 as a library that is developed for it from the ground-up). Lastly, Angular 1.x performance issues are by know known by all developers. If you want to use it, take this into consideration. In particular, consider that Angular 2 is significantly better than Angular 1 in every metric (to be fair, Angular 1 and 2 are different enough to be considered totally different libraries, only inspired by similar concepts).

Some oddities in the results (for instance cito.js appearing slower in dropped frame counts and FPS counts when subjective tests tell otherwise) make us think something else is going on behind the scenes, so take these results as what they are: a small and probably biased sample. Our methodology and testing tools probably need an improvement.

Trust me, I can tell your thoughts about this change. You are probably asking yourself (or actually your computer screen) why on earth would the Angular team make such a huge jump. After all, you are (or at least you think you are) fine with what you already have in Angular 1.

Give your code editor a little break so we can discuss on why this jump is necessary and ways we can jump and not fall.

<h2>Why Turn to Angular 2?</h2>

Angular 1.x is fine and here to stay but Angular 2 is better. Do you think the Angular team are just jobless and work on creating something useless? No of course! So sit tight so we can talk about it.

The fact that Angular 2 exists does not mean Angular 1 will be deprecated or lack support. We know how it goes in IT generally, people still use IE 8, older versions of Android, Web Forms for .Net developers, etc. This is why Angular 1, for the time being is still here to stay.

Having made this point, let us actually take a look at why you should start considering Angular 2.

<h3>Performance</h3>

Performance is always the first point when talking about benefits of Angular 2. The reason being that critics were on the teamâ€™s neck concerning the speed and performance of Angular 1 even as mush. This could be found mostly in Angularâ€™s data binding concept.

Angular 2 had better strategies and concepts to improve the performance of web applications made with Angular.

<h3>Better Mobile Support</h3>

Angular 1.x was not built with mobile support in mind, but fortunately frameworks like Ionic found favor in them.

Angular was implemented in frameworks like Ionic in a hard manner which was detrimental to the userâ€™s experience and performance of the application in general.

With all this terrible experience, Angular 2 was designed to be better and ready for any thing coming its way that is mobile oriented.

<h3>Better Learning Path</h3>

It took me three weeks to wrap my head around the concept of Angular 1 but it took my co-developer who never used Angular 1 four days to understand Angular 2.
If you have looked at an Angular 2 app file, you should recognize this:

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>import {Component} from 'angular2/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: '<h1>{{ title }}</h1>'
})

export class AppComponent { 
    title = "My First Angular 2 App"
}</code></pre>

Looking at this piece of code, might get you intimidated at first but there is nothing more to Angular 2 than just that (and a more of it when your app grows). If you understand that basic syntax, you are good to go.

On the other hand, compare it with the way we learned Angular 1.x. The docs were crazy. There were tons of complicated documentations to study. It took me three weeks to wrap my head around the concept of Angular 1 but it took my co-developer who never used Angular 1 four days to understand Angular 2.

<h3>The Future</h3>

Angular 2 uses all the promising features the web as a whole is coming up with. ES2015 also known as ES6 is the major ECMAScript version for Angular implemented with TypeScript.

Web Components are the future of the Web and if you are not planning to accept that yet, then you are driving on the wrong lane.

<h2>Upgrading to Angular 2</h2>

Upgrading to Angular 2 is quite an easy step to take, but one that should be made carefully.

There are two major ways to feel the taste of Angular 2 in your project. Which you use depends on whatever requirements your project has. The angular team have provided two paths to this:

<h3>ngForward</h3>

ng-forward-logo

ngForward is not a real upgrade framework for Angular 2 but instead we can use it to create Angular 1 apps that look like Angular 2.

If you still feel uncomfortable upgrading your existing application to Angular 2, you can fall to ngForward to feel the taste and sweetness of the good tidings Angular 2 brings but still remain in your comfort zone.

You can either re-write your angular app gradually to look as if it was written in Angular 2 or add features in an Angular 2 manner leaving the existing project untouched. Another benefit that comes with this is that it prepares you and your team for the future even when you choose to hold onto the past for a little bit longer.

I will guide you through a basic setup to use ngForward but in order to be on track, have a look at the Quick Start for Angular 2.

In your existing Angular 1.x (should be 1.3+) app run:

<pre class="line-numbers language-markup"><code>npm i --save ng-forward@latest reflect-metadata </code></pre>

This installs the latest version of ngForward and also the reflect-metadatamodule. Now prepare your index.html to look like what we have below:

<pre class="line-numbers language-php"><code class='language-php'><!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <title>Ng-Forward Sample</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

If you took time to review the Quick Start as I suggested, you wonâ€™t be lost with the configuration. SystemJS is used to load the Angular application after it has been bootstrapped as we will soon see. Finally in our app.ts, we can code like itâ€™s Angular 2.

<pre class="line-numbers language-javascript"><code class='language-javascript'>import {Component,  bootstrap} from 'ng-forward';

@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: '<h1>{{title}}</h1>'
})
class AppComponent { 
    title = "My First Angular 2 App"
}
bootstrap(AppComponent);</code></pre>

<h3>ngUpgrade</h3>

Writing an Angular 1.x app that looks like Angular 2 is not good enough. We need the real stuff. The challenge then becomes that with a large existing Angular 1.x project, it becomes really difficult to re-write all our app to Angular 2, and even using ngForward would not be ideal. This is where ngUpgrade comes to our aid. ngUpgrade is the real stuff.

Unlike ngForward, ngUpgrade was covered clearly in the Angular 2 docs. If you fall in the category of developers that will take this path, then spare few minutes and digest this.

Weâ€™ll also be writing more articles on upgrading to Angular 2 and weâ€™ll focus more on ngUpgrade in a future article.

<h2>Final Remarks</h2>

One thing I have observed as an experienced Angular developer is that the Angular team has a good habit of providing tons of option to solve a single problem.

Just as we saw in this guide, you can just use Angular 2 from scratch, write Angular 1 in Angular 2 form or gradually leverage ngUpgrade to upgrade your existing.";s:10:"post_title";s:49:"Seamless Ways to Upgrade Angular 1.x to Angular 2";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:49:"seamless-ways-to-upgrade-angular-1-x-to-angular-2";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-02-22 14:33:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-02-22 14:33:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"http://scriptsvn.com/?p=327";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"9";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:34;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"139";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2015-11-25 16:53:30";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-25 16:53:30";s:12:"post_content";s:2182:"If you Â running on Hackintosh, you will can't useÂ BootCamp, but you can try this method with the terminal.

<ol>
<li>Download the ISO you want to use</li>
<li>Open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities)</li>
</ol>

2.1 Navigate to the path where the .iso file is located

2.2 Use ls to list all the folders

2.3 cd /path/to/iso to dive in to folder or cd .. to go back the path

Convert .iso to .img using hdiutil:
hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o /path/to/target.img /path/to/source.iso
Rename if OS X gave it a .dmg ending:
mv /path/to/target.img.dmg path/to/target.img
Type diskutil list to get a list of currently connected devices
Insert USB drive you want to use
Run diskutil list again to see what your USB stick gets assigned eg - /dev/disk3
Run diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN (where N is the number assigned to your USB stick, in previous example it would be 3)
Run sudo dd if=/path/to/target.img of=/dev/diskN bs=1m (if you get an error, replace bs=1m with bs=1M
Run diskutil eject /dev/diskN and remove your USB stick
The USB stick will now be ready to use
IMPORTANT For the step #9 you can use the destination to /dev/rdiskN to reduce the copy time.

NOTE: Sometimes, not always, Step #4 will be necessary. Not all the time. I am not sure why it will add the .dmg ending and other times leave it alone.

NOTE 2: Might I suggest you learn the name of the .iso you downloaded, or just rename it win8.1.iso or something, and put it on your Desktop folder. That way, when you are typing commands like #3 and #4 etc, etc, you can type it like this:

hdiutil convert -format UDRW -o ~/Desktop/win8.1.img ~/Desktop/win8.1.iso
and

mv ~/Desktop/win8.1.img.dmg ~/Desktop/win8.1.img
and step #9 would look like this:

sudo dd if=~/Desktop/win8.1.img of=/dev/diskN bs=1m
IMPORTANT - You can track the progress by pressing CTRL + T It will show the process info and records in and out, since we use the bs=1m each record is 1Mb in size so you can easily track the progress.

I don't mean to be insulting with Note and Note2, I am just making sure that you know what all these commands mean. It's the simplest method.

<b><u>LAST UPDATED: January 6, 2014</u></b>

<a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php">Multibeast</a>Â is a essentially an installer bundled with a lot of <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/01/what-are-kexts.html">kext files</a> for Hackintoshes. When you're setting up Mac OS X, it can be a huge time saver. By using Multibeast, you don't have to find, download, and install every single kext file that your Hackintosh needs, one by one. Multibeast has it all. However, the problem with Multibeast's all-in-one method is that there are simply too many options to make sense of. In this guide, I'm going to explain all of the important options in the app.

<b>NOTE:</b> You have to register on <a href="http://tonymacx86.com/">tonymacx86.com</a> to download Multibeast and related apps. After installing anything in Multibeast, you should reboot your Hackintosh to see if the changes worked.

Quick Start -&gt; Easybeast/UserDSDT/DSDT-Free

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XUUcYh7tDbQ/VGZg1jiD4uI/AAAAAAAAF0c/-xPPpdIHl-I/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B5.png"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XUUcYh7tDbQ/VGZg1jiD4uI/AAAAAAAAF0c/-xPPpdIHl-I/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B5.png" alt="" width="640" height="516" border="0" /></a></div>

These options are the cornerstone of the tonymacx86 method; installing any of these three options will enable Mac OS X to boot normally from the hard drive of your Hackintosh, without any extra assistance.

<b>DSDT Free</b> is the the most common option these days. You should choose "DSDT Free" if your computer has a motherboard thatÂ <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/08/set-up-hackintosh-gigabyte-uefi.html">uses UEFI instead of BIOS</a> (a.k.a virtually every board made from 2012 onwards). Installing it is very simple-- just set it and forget it.

However, installing DSDT Free by itself isn't always enough to make Mac OS X boot properly. If you're using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)">Intel Haswell processor</a> and your motherboard doesn't support Mac OS X's CPU power management by default, you'll also have to manually patch the OS X kernel yourself to get things working (<a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/mavericks-laptop-support/114677-haswell-early-reboot-mavericks-locked-msrs-hp-envy-15-j063cl-i7-4700mq.html">check out the "How to patch your kernel" section of this tonymacx86 guide</a>Â for more details). Alternatively, if you're using an older Intel processor and your motherboard doesn't support OS X power management by default, you'll have to eitherÂ <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/11/how-to-set-up-asus-hackintosh.html">manually patch your motherboard's BIOS</a>,Â install NullCPUPowerManagement (mentioned below in this guide), <i>or</i> install a patched version of AppleIntelCPUPower Management (also mentioned below).

<b>UserDSDT</b> is the best option if your motherboard needs a DSDT file, which is a configuration file that customizes Mac OS X to work with your specific board. Usually, only older motherboards that still use BIOS instead of UEFI will need this option.

If your motherboard has a DSDT file available in the <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/content/11-dsdt-database.html">DSDT section of tonymacx86</a>, use it. (You can also <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2014/03/how-to-edit-your-own-dsdt-with-maciasl.html">create your own DSDT file with MaciASL</a>, although this is usually unnecessary.) To install UserDSDT on Mac OS X this way, you first have to download the appropriate DSDT file onto your Hackintosh. Then you open Multibeast, and select the UserDSDT option; Multibeast will ask you to select your DSDT file, and you'll be good to go.

When installing UserDSDT with a DSDT file, make sure that your motherboard has <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/02/check-bios-version-of-gigabyte.html">the right BIOS version</a>, or the DSDT file won't work. For example, a DSDT file for version F4 won't work if your motherboard has version F1. Read <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/01/how-to-update-your-bios-on-gigabyte.html">this</a> to learn how to update your BIOS version.

<b>Easybeast</b> is similar to UserDSDT, except it tries to remove the need for a DSDT file by installing some extra kext files. If your motherboard needs a DSDT file but doesn't have one, try installing Easybeast instead. Easybeast will break sleep mode and speedstepping (CPU power management-- this means that your computer will be less energy efficient). It doesn't work if your computer uses an Intel Haswell processor, due to incompatibilities with NullCPUPowerManagement.

Drivers -&gt; Audio

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L1ITYy-veUY/VGZhmeCHqPI/AAAAAAAAF0k/86Rux6z57UE/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B6.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L1ITYy-veUY/VGZhmeCHqPI/AAAAAAAAF0k/86Rux6z57UE/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B6.png" alt="" width="640" height="512" border="0" /></a></div>

All of the motherboards recommended by tonymacx86 use Realtek Audio. To enable sound on these motherboards, you'll want to install the <b>Realtek ALC8xx</b> kexts. Luckily, the Realtek ALC8xx section of Multibeast 5 is pretty straightforward.

<div class="separator"></div>

All you need to know is the audio codec of your motherboard. You can find your audio codec by Googling the model of your motherboard. The first Google result will be the motherboard's official product page. The audio codec is usually found under the "Specifications" section, or some other similarly-named section. For example, my Hackintosh has a Gigabyte GA-P67A-D3-B3 motherboard. According to the <a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3800#sp">official product page</a>, this motherboard uses the Realtek 889 codec. So I would choose "ALC889" under the "Realtek ALCxxx" section to enable audio.

If your Hackintosh is specifically using the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/">Clover EFI bootloader</a> (which we generally don't support here on MacBreaker) instead of the normal Chameleon or Chimera bootloader, you will have to check <b>Optional EFI Installed Bootloader Support</b> for any of these audio options to work properly.

If you have a motherboard that doesn't use the Realtek audio codec (or it has an unsupported codec version), you'll have to go with the <b>Universal</b> kexts. VoodooHDA enables sound for a wide variety of motherboards, but it's not very reliable. Install just <i>one</i> of the versions and reboot to see if it works well for you. If not, remove the kext by going to /System/Library/Extensions in your hard drive and deleting VoodooHDA.kext. Then try another version.

Drivers -&gt; Disk

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Kdk0sH7H-nE/VGZkZthHhYI/AAAAAAAAF0w/UeZHFBWsV9o/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B7.png"><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Kdk0sH7H-nE/VGZkZthHhYI/AAAAAAAAF0w/UeZHFBWsV9o/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B7.png" alt="" width="640" height="514" border="0" /></a></div>

Almost all hard drives should work with Mac OS X by default, but you still might encounter glitches here and there. These kexts fix hard drive-related problems.

For example, on some Hackintoshes, your hard drives will show up as orange external drives on your desktop. Install<b>IOAHCI Block Storage Injector</b> to fix that (this kext should be unnecessary on Hackintoshes that use UserDSDT or DSDT Free).

If your Hackintosh uses a relatively new motherboard with the Intel 9 series chipset (this includes Z97, H97, X79, and X99 motherboards), you may need to install <b>Intel Generic AHCI SATA</b> in order for Mac OS X to recognize your hard drives properly.

You can also install <b>TRIM Enabler</b> to enable TRIM in Mac OS X, which is a critical feature for <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/05/hackintosh-ssds-all-you-need-to-know.html">SSD drives</a>.

Drivers -&gt; Graphics

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzuCqnFLNyY/VGZlCtgNLWI/AAAAAAAAF04/xJfAzGJ30Rc/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B8.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzuCqnFLNyY/VGZlCtgNLWI/AAAAAAAAF04/xJfAzGJ30Rc/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B8.png" alt="" width="640" height="514" border="0" /></a></div>

These days, many graphics cards work out of the box in Mac OS X, without the need for extra drivers. As a result, there isn't much to see in the Graphics section of Multibeast. Check out our <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/06/hackintosh-graphics-cards.html">graphics card guide</a> for more details.

Right now, the only thing in this section is the <b>Intel Graphics Patch for Mixed Configurations</b>. Intel's 2nd-generation "Sandy Bridge" processors are compatible with their 3rd-generation "Ivy Bridge" motherboards. The same is true the other way around: Ivy Bridge processors are also compatible with Sandy Bridge motherboards. However, building your Hackintosh with these mixed configurations prevents your processor's integrated graphics from working properly in Mac OS X. You need to install this patch to fix the problem.

Drivers -&gt; Miscellaneous/System

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S-dMq-X1BSE/VGZlHQd1WlI/AAAAAAAAF1A/F2eZSGe3ev4/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B9.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S-dMq-X1BSE/VGZlHQd1WlI/AAAAAAAAF1A/F2eZSGe3ev4/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B9.png" alt="" width="640" height="518" border="0" /></a></div>

The Miscellaneous and System sections contain kexts that fix random issues in Mac OS X. In Multibeast 7, the difference between these two sections is very unclear, so I've included explanations for both sections.

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"></div>

<b>NullCPUPowerManagement</b> (NCPM) fixes boot errors caused by Apple's CPU power management service. These errors happen on Hackintoshes that don't work with just UserDSDT or DSDT Free alone. Installing NCPM breaks sleep mode and speed-stepping (CPU power management). This kext is installed by default when you run Easybeast. It no longer works on motherboards forÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)">Intel "Haswell" processors</a>Â (a.k.a most boards made in 2013 or newer).

The <b>FakeSMC Plugins</b> are a set of plugins that enable system-monitoring apps to read your Hackintosh's CPU temperature and GPU temperature.
Installing <b>USB 3.0 - Universal</b> enables USB 3.0 support on Hackintoshes. In the past, USB 3.0 was a rather hit-and-miss feature for Hackintoshes: it worked for some people, and caused booting errors for others. Support has gotten better over time, however. These days, you can usually expect USB 3.0 to work as long as you install these drivers.

If you're using an older mouse or keyboard that doesn't connect to your Hackintosh with a USB port, install <b>PS/2 Keyboard/Mice</b>.

If your Hackintosh <a href="http://www.tonymacx86.com/general-hardware-discussion/127513-os-x-10-9-2-compatibility-report-socket-2011-a.html">uses an Intel Xeon CPU in the "Ivy Bridge-E" product line</a>, you'll probably have to install<b>VoodooTSCSync</b> to boot Mac OS X properly. The installation process is pretty simple: if your CPU has 4 processor cores, choose "VoodooTSCSync 4 Core". And so on. Sometimes, you'll also need to install this option in conjunction with NullCPUPowerManagement.

<div class="separator"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TZIZj3FBWs/VGZnkAKNurI/AAAAAAAAF1U/2-Lv6bgiKXs/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B11.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3TZIZj3FBWs/VGZnkAKNurI/AAAAAAAAF1U/2-Lv6bgiKXs/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B11.png" alt="" width="640" height="518" border="0" /></a></div>

<b>Patched Apple Intel CPU Power Management</b> is an alternative to NullCPUPowerManagement. It does the same thing as NCPM, except it doesn't break sleep mode or speed-stepping. These patches are version-specific, so every time you update Mac OS X, you'll have to install a new version of the patch (although the most recent 10.9 patch actually works for all versions of 10.9 <i>and</i>Â 10.10!). Like with NullCPUPowerManagement, however, this kext no longer works on motherboards forÂ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)">Intel "Haswell" processors</a>Â (a.k.a most boards made in 2013 or newer).

Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4 removed support for X58 motherboards, making Hackintoshes that use these motherboards unable to boot without help in Mountain Lion, even after installing UserDSDT, DSDT Free, or Easybeast. Also, many non-Gigabyte motherboards encountered booting problems in OS X Mountain Lion version 10.8.2 due to driver incompatibilities. If your Hackintosh cannot start normally due to either of these problems, boot into OS X with the help of your Unibeast USB drive (or <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/p/installation-guides.html">whatever installer USB drive you used</a>), and install <b>AppleACPIPlatform Rollback.</b>

Drivers -&gt; Network

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0V6_V4cMoHc/VGZoFtPD_AI/AAAAAAAAF1c/3kqOLOpi99s/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B10.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0V6_V4cMoHc/VGZoFtPD_AI/AAAAAAAAF1c/3kqOLOpi99s/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B10.png" alt="" width="640" height="514" border="0" /></a></div>

These kexts should enable connecting to the internet on your Hackintosh, via an Ethernet cord. To find out which kext you need to install, you need to know what ethernet controller your motherboard has.

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"></div>

Different manufacturers use different controllers; check what controller your motherboard uses by Googling your board's name (or model number) to find the official manufacturer webpage for it. Most manufacturers list the ethernet controller of a motherboard under the "Specifications" section of its official page.

If your motherboard uses something in Realtek 8100 series of Ethernet controllers (e.g. my old Gigabyte GA-P67A-D3-B3 motherboard used the "Realtek RTL8111E" controller), try installing <b>Realtek - AppleRTL8169Ethernet</b> first. If that doesn't work, try installing <b>RealtekRTL81xx</b>Â or <b>RealtekRTL8111</b>Â instead; these alternative options work better for some people.

The same suggestion applies for all of the other options: <b>ALXEthernet</b> and <b>AtherosL1cEthernet </b>both work on motherboards with Atheros AR8100-series ethernet controllers. If installing one option doesn't work, try the other. <b>Killer ALXEthernet </b>and <b>AtherosE2200Ethernet</b> both work on boards with Atheros Killer E2200-series controllers.<b>AppleIntelE1000e </b>and <b>AppleIGB</b> both work on motherboards with Intel 82500-series controllers (although AppleIGB also works on Intel i250, i210, and i211 controllers).

Customization -&gt; Boot Options

<div class="separator"></div>

<div class="separator"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-49DIcEDZ8PY/VGZqlmOgRhI/AAAAAAAAF1o/g2YUKZHuSco/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B12.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-49DIcEDZ8PY/VGZqlmOgRhI/AAAAAAAAF1o/g2YUKZHuSco/s1600/Region%2Bcapture%2B12.png" alt="" width="640" height="512" border="0" /></a></div>

Most of the options in this section make edits to org.Chameleon.boot.plist, a settings file that configures how your Hackintosh boots. If you want, you can also <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/01/how-to-use-boot-flags-for-your.html">make all of these changes manually</a>. Check out our <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/01/list-of-common-hackintosh-boot-flags_29.html">list of common boot options</a> for more details.

Installing <b>1080p</b> will tell Mac OS X to display the Apple bootscreen at 1920x1080 resolution during start up. This feature is not supported on all graphics cards (to enable it on unsupported NVIDIA cards, read our guide on editing <a href="http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/06/how-to-set-your-hackintosh-bootscreen.html">VESA resolutions</a>). In addition, this feature only works once you enable full graphics support on your Hackintosh.

If you want your Hackintosh to let your choose your own hard drive at the bootscreen instead of just automatically loading Mac OS X, you can install <b>Instant Menu</b> to fix that.

<i>Uncheck </i><b>Generate CPU States</b>Â ifÂ your Hackintosh has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)#Haswell_Refresh">Haswell "Refresh"</a> Intel Core processor (a.ka. pretty much anything made in 2014 or newer). Generating CPU states usually helps Mac OS X's power management work with your computer, but it may also cause freezing if your computer uses a new processor that is still unsupported by Apple.

Customization -&gt; System Definitions

<div class="separator"></div>

Occasionally, a certain System Definition will make your Hackintosh run a lot slower than it should. <a href="http://www.primatelabs.ca/geekbench/">Geekbench</a> is a good benchmark to compare your Hackintosh against other Hackintoshes and Macs (the free trial lasts forever). If you feel that your Geekbench score is unusually slow compared to Hackintoshes or Macs with similar hardware, try installing a different System Definition.

In most cases, any system definition will work. The most notable exceptions are the the <b>Mac Pro (4,1) </b>and <b>Mac Pro (5,1)</b>system definitions, which cause booting problems. If you insist on installing either of these two system definitions, be sure to remove AppleTyMCEDriver.kext and AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext from /System/Library/Extensions beforehand (the system definitions mess up these two kexts).

iOS 9 is now publicly released. Itâ€™s a subtle change but the system fonts of iOS 9 are now changed to the Appleâ€™s new San Francisco fonts, replacing the previous Helvetica Neue.
<!--more-->

Helvetica (left), San Francisco (right)
San Francisco fonts have been used in Apple Watch already, and San Francisco is now the standard font unifying the Apple platform: Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad and Mac.

Apple Watch
Apple has been using Helvetica as the system fonts for iOS since the first iPhone, and they also switched the fonts from Lucida Grande to Helvetica for Mac OS X since 10.10 Yosemite. Why did Apple decide to ditch Helvetica, which is the most famous and loved font in the world?
Helvetica is weak in small sizes
It is said that Helvetica is not suited for texts in small sizes. When the system fonts for Mac OS X Yosemite are changed to Helvetica, many designers claimed that Helvetica is not appropriate one.

â€œHelvetica sucksâ€ by Erik Spiekermann
You can see the low legibility of Helvetica if you type texts in a small size and make them blur. Some texts become blended and hard to decipher. They say that Apple developed San Francisco fonts in order to make small size texts in Apple Watch more legible.

The letters become blended in small size texts
But nowadays, smart devices have more resolution than paper printing, and texts in iPhone are not always as small as in Apple Watch. Why Apple changed the system fonts for iOS and Mac OS X, not only for Apple Watch?
San Francisco is not a single font
San Francisco fonts have lots of features to be highly legible. In fact, the San Francisco fonts for Apple Watch and for iOS/Mac are not same.
The font family named â€œSFâ€ is used for iOS/Mac and â€œSF Compactâ€ is for Apple Watch. You can see the difference in round shaped letters like â€˜oâ€™, â€˜eâ€™. SF compact has rather flat vertical lines than that of SF.

SF and SF Compact
This difference gives texts in SF Compact more margins between letters, resulting in high legibility in small devices like Apple Watch.
In addition, SF and SF Compact fonts are divided into two sub font families named â€œTextâ€ and â€œDisplayâ€. This is what Apple calls â€œOptical Sizesâ€. The Text fonts are for smaller texts, and the Display fonts for bigger.

San Francisco Family
As I mentioned above, with grotesque (or sans serif) fonts like Helvetica, two adjacent letters become â€œblendedâ€, and letters like â€˜aâ€™, â€˜eâ€™, â€˜sâ€™ looks similar in small sizes.

Display and Text fonts
The San Francisco Text fonts, which are used for texts in small sizes, are designed to have more margins than the Display fonts. And the apertures of the Text fonts are also wider in order to be legible in small sizes.
San Francisco fonts are dynamic
One of the great features of San Francisco is the way it optimizes the typeface dynamically. The system will automatically switch the Display/Text fonts according to the text size. Specifically, 20pt is the boundary.

Designers and engineers donâ€™t have to care about which font to use. Just set the system fonts to UILabel for example, and then the system will give you an appropriate typeface for you.
What have impressed me about San Francisco fonts is the way colons (:) are displayed. Basically, a colon will be placed right above the baseline, so itâ€™s not vertically centered if it is placed between numbers. San Francisco fonts, on the other hand, will make it vertically centered automatically.

Vertically Centered Colon
San Francisco is the font for the digital age
As you see, San Francisco fonts are carefully designed to be easy to read in any text size and on any device.
Helvetica, which was replaced by San Francisco fonts, was created in Switzerland in 1957, when there were no digital devices. Helvetica is widely used by many companies as the corporate type even now, and no doubt it will be used in the future as a great classic font.
San Francisco, on the other hand, is a modern font. It will change the typefaces dynamically according to the context. It is a kind of â€œDigital Nativeâ€ fonts for the digital age.";s:10:"post_title";s:51:"The Secret of the Appleâ€™s New San Francisco Fonts";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"the-secret-of-the-apples-new-san-francisco-fonts";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-11-14 04:44:21";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-14 04:44:21";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"http://scriptsvn.com/?p=128";s:10:"menu_order";s:2:"13";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:38;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"124";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2015-11-12 02:09:18";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-12 02:09:18";s:12:"post_content";s:13837:"##1. Introduction A short while ago, our team had to choose a technology for Wix's flagship product, the html wysiwyg website editor. It is a large single-page application, with complex flows, communication with other iframes and servers, and a lot of user experiences. This product is developed by more than 40 developers. The choices were ReactJS or AngularJS. We had experience with both, and were struggling between the ease-of-use of Angular declarative programming and the simplicity of React. We started a proof of concept that ultimately drove us to form a tie breaker. This article is about the comparisonâ€¦ and the tie breaker.<!--more-->

<h3 id="1-1-packaging">1.1 Packaging</h3>

Packaging is the ability to run and deploy your code in the way you want it. In order to achieve fast loading time, we want to load the bare minimum at first and continue on demand. This also gives us the ability to continue to develop new features without slowly degrading the load time.

Angular provides a very limited ability to do so (mostly html templates) and when we tweaked it to do what we wanted, it looked like assembly code.

In short, we found Angular to be too opinionated and too rigid. React doesn't care, it's plain JS and allows us to use requirejs to lazy load pieces of code. It also allows for working with other solutions like webpack.

<em>Winner: React</em>

<h3 id="1-2-learning-curve">1.2 Learning curve</h3>

Everybody knows about the bumpy road to mastering Angular: it's quick to get started, then it improves and deteriorates as you go along, a lot like marriageâ€¦

We found that you can learn React to a high standard in just a week. It takes some time to get used to the one-way flow, especially for web developers, but once you do, it's very lucid.

The lifecycle of Angular is complex, and to master it, you really need to read the code. Compile and link are not intuitive, and specific cases can be confusing (recursion in compile, collisions between directives). React, on the other hand, has only a few lifecycle methods, and they are self explanatory. The best feature we found with React is that never, even once, did we have to read its code.

<em>Winner: React</em>

<h3 id="1-3-abstraction">1.3 Abstraction</h3>

Good abstraction is priceless. Abstraction provides fast development and hides details that are not necessary for the developer using a library.

We found Angular's abstraction to be leaky. This means that in order to actually work with it, you need to understand the underlying model. This is why so many people need to debug the internals of Angular when debugging their code.

There are concepts that are exposed in order to treat the leaks, for example, directive priority. But how do I control priorities when using directives from different 3rd party vendors? Why should I care? Why is it that different directives sometimes don't work nicely together on the same html node? Why do I need to know about digest cycles?

React's abstraction results in it being less flexible in parts, like not being able to add attributes to html tags, or a single tag for a component. This is solved by React's implementation of mixins (that allow overlap only on lifecycle methods, and have a predictable execution order) and the fact that it doesn't leak (like I mentioned above, we never had to open it's code).

<em>Winner: React</em>

<h3 id="1-4-model-complexity">1.4 Model complexity</h3>

By model complexity, I'm referring to how you structure the data model that is later represented by the view.

Angular's performance is sensitive when dealing with scope because of copy-n-compare. This means that you cannot use large models. This has pros and cons. Pros, as it makes the code simpler and more testable; but cons, as it forces you to break down stuff that you'd normally use, and rebuild it back up (for server request for example).

React gives you the freedom to choose, without the performance penalty. The outcome really depends on whether you're a good coder or a bad coder.

<em>Winner: tie</em>

<h3 id="1-5-debugging">1.5 Debugging</h3>

When something doesn't work, we all start the tedious task of debugging. I'll separate this into two main scenarios - figuring why your logic is not working, and understanding the outputted HTML along with what generated it.

Angular is an event driven system, which is always easier to write and harder to debug as the stack-traces end up longer and different than what you'd expect. However Angular does a good job of providing constructs that are logical, like services. If used correctly, they make the code easier to test and debug, but any good programmer will try to separate code and logic with or without them.

When something doesn't work in Angular directives, one option is to re-write the code in a different way because there's so much magic going on. Another option is to debug Angular's code - not a trivial task.

React has two main scenarios - updating the model/doing other actions as a result of user events; and the one-way rendering flow which is always the same. This means that there are fewer places to look for your bugs and the stack traces have clear distinction between React's code, and your own. They normally don't mix. React also has less magic, and it's all concentrated in one place - the vDom comparison. It is a closed black box but in our experience, it worked as expected.

When talking about understanding the HTML, and back-tracing to the code, the story is the opposite. In React, it is hard to compare your code to the resulting HTML. Even when using jsx, you can hardly compare them as "if" and "repeat" control flows break the HTML fragments into tiny chunks of templates. In Angular, however, the result closely resembles the HTML template.

<em>Winner JS: React</em> <em>Winner HTML: Angular</em>

<h3 id="1-6-binding">1.6 Binding</h3>

In Angular, you can only bind to scope. This means that in complex scenarios like binding to a server/async service, or when binding to a large model, you will need to have an intermediate model in the way, plus you will need to deal with digest cycles and with explicit watches.

In contrast, React only provides syntactic sugar for binding that is called valueLink (a single attribute for both "value" and "onChange" properties). This concept is so simple that it doesn't sound like it will do the job, yet it does. And if you understand it well, you will be able to create your own linkState or similar functions that will answer all of your binding needs.

<em>Winner: React</em>

<h3 id="1-7-performance-tweaking">1.7 Performance tweaking</h3>

React makes it simple to control the performance. If you implement shouldComponentUpdate, you can choose which comparison you prefer - model or presentation. If your model is small, just let React do the comparison on the vDom. If your model is complex, or you create a lot of DOM, you can optimize it by a custom implementation of this function, where you can devise your own mechanisms for dirty-checking that can be very efficient.

In Angular, however, you need to start counting scopes (there are numerous utilities that do it for you), and in some cases, you just have to implement the internals of a component in pure js and wrap it in Angular for convenience. The evidence of this is the amount of articles you can find about Angular performance tweakingâ€¦

<em>Winner: React</em>

<h3 id="1-8-code-re-use">1.8 Code re-use</h3>

Angular gets points for having sooo much stuff ready for it out there, however it's not trivial to use Angular libraries from more than one provider due to namespace and priority collisions. React lets you manage it the way you like. Saying that, Angular is still stronger in the market and has more ready-made stuff to offer.

<em>Winner: tie</em>

<h3 id="1-9-templating">1.9 Templating</h3>

I saved the most important one for lastâ€¦ Even though most of the Angular or React articles discuss directives or data-flows, the reality is that when writing an online service, 80% of what you are doing is writing UI. I call them panels, the building blocks of application logic. They contain a lot of information and custom flows, and are built using ready-made building blocks, but they are not generally re-usable, and they are the bulk of what our users see and interact with. React does poor job with those. When writing a repeater it will look backwards:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-php">var createItem = function(itemText) {
  return <li>{itemText}</li>;
};
return <ul>{this.props.items.map(createItem)}</ul></code></pre>

Whereas in Angular it will look like:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-php"><ul>
<li ng-repeat="item in items">{{item}}</li>
</ul></code></pre>

How much better is that? (Answer: a lot). So Angular is a clear winner in this section.

<em>Winner: Angular</em>

##2. The tie-breaker - React-templates So, how do we resolve this debate? How can we get all of the benefits of React stated above, but not miss out on this great, super-important feature of Angular? We decided to give it a go and solve it for React.

The design consideration for the tool were:

<ul>
    <li>Any valid HTML file is a valid reactTemplate, almost. We keep event notation camelCase like React, and also the notation for no-value attributes like disabled (true/false values will determine whether they appear in the actual DOM)</li>
    <li>Switch from html context to js context with curly braces, and inside directives</li>
    <li>Conversion should not be in runtime, so it doesn't affect performance. No additional objects for scope or runtime code, use only js native constructs (closures, methods, native expressions) to achieve this functionality</li>
    <li>Make the generated code as human parse-able as possible</li>
    <li>Directives are inspired by Angularjs and should be obvious to people with prior Angular experience</li>
    <li>Keep it small and simple. Directives need justification to be added (the entire converter is 350 lines of code)</li>
</ul>

And the result is the <a href="http://wix.github.io/react-templates/">amazing React templates</a>. We've got all of Angular templating values with the simplicity of React! We get complete separation between presentation and logic, declarative writing of panels, and to make it even more useful, we've added module loader support (either AMD or CommonJS) to allow reuse of other components within the templates themselves. Let's see a few examples to show how simple this is.

###2.1 Collection iteration

[html]{item} at index {itemIndex}[/html]

Note: <code>itemIndex</code> is derived from the name item, to allow using indices of nested repeaters

###2.2 If statement

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class='language-php'><label rt-if="this.hasError()">
  {this.getError()}
</label></code></pre>

Note: this is a true <code>if</code>, meaning that will not render the node at all if the expression is false.

###2.3 Syntactic sugars - rt-class, rt-scope, expressions in attributes

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-php"><div rt-scope="this.getUserDetails() as theUser" title="{theUser.loginName}">
Real Name: {theUser.firstName} {theUser.lastName}<br/>
Login: {theUser.loginName}
Last paid at: <span rt-class="{status:true, overdue:this.isUserOverdue(theUser)}">{theUser.lastPaid}</span>
</div></code></pre>

Note: We've been really careful not to create too many of these, as we wanted to keep it simple. Only the stuff that adds a lot of value has been added.

###2.4 Transclusion
[html]&lt;div&gt;{this.props.children}&lt;/div&gt;[/html]
Note: Really simpleâ€¦

<h3 id="2-5-handling-events">2.5 Handling events</h3>

<pre class='line-numbers'><code class='language-php'><div>
  <div rt-repeat="task in tasks" style="font-weight:{task.selected ? â€˜boldâ€™ : â€˜normalâ€™ }" onClick="() => this.toggleTask(task)">{task.title}</div>
  <button onClick="{this.save}">Save</button>
</div>
</code></pre>

Note: This is one of the nicest things in React templates. We generate methods for you, so that you don't need to store anything on DOM or work with indices. You can just write your logic code and work with your objects. There are 2 options supported: lambda expression, or if the {} notation is used, it is an expression that should return a pointer to a function. And lastly, every custom attribute for custom control that starts with on and a camelCase event name can work with both notations.

###2.5 Loading resources for the templates

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class='language-php' ><rt-require dependency="./utils/translate" as="tr"/>
<rt-require dependency="./comps/colorPicker" as="colorPicker"/>
<form>
  {tr(â€˜Enter_Your_Nameâ€™)}: <input type="text" valueLink="{this.linkState(â€˜nameâ€™)}"/>
  {tr(â€˜Choose_Favorite_Colorâ€™)}: <colorPicker valueLink="{this.linkState(â€˜favColorâ€™)}"/>
</form>
</code></pre>

###2.6 Other goodies The style attribute (just) works as in html. This means that there is no need to translate the keys to camelCase (as required by React), and you can, like everywhere else, use the {} notation to insert an expression. "class" attribute also works (without the need to call it "className").

##3. Summary Both frameworks are awesome, and it's hard to decide which to use. Angular is very opinionated, which can be great if it fits your development scenario. React gives you freedom and simplicity, but lacks the declarative power of Angular. However, when using react-templates, you'll get to use a lot of the stuff we love about Angular, but without the messy stuff. For people that are strong in vanillajs, have complex projects, care about file packaging or want to use a framework in conjunction with other libraries, we believe that React + react-templates is a winning solution.";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"Compare: Angular vs. React  - what is better";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:39:"compare-angular-vs-react-what-is-better";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-11-12 02:09:18";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-11-12 02:09:18";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:27:"http://scriptsvn.com/?p=124";s:10:"menu_order";s:2:"14";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:39;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:3:"111";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2015-10-23 02:51:41";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2015-10-23 02:51:41";s:12:"post_content";s:13562:"Ruby is a programming language designed by Yukihiro â€œMatzâ€ Matsumoto, with a focus on programmers productivity and fun. The author stated it himself many times in interviews and talks, such as Google Tech Talk in 2008: â€œI hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.â€
<!--more-->

I believe Matz did a great job in achieving his goals. Letâ€™s have a look at some of the things that Ruby got right. This short list can serve either as a reminder for those who already know Ruby, or as a set of arguments for convincing you that itâ€™s worth investing your time to learn Ruby, if you havenâ€™t done so yet.

<h3>Object model</h3>

â€œEverything is an objectâ€ - you have probably heard this statement repeated over and over for every object oriented language, like Java or C#, only to find out later that these languages have many exception to this rule, such as primitive types - numbers or boolean values. Rubyâ€™s object model, greatly inspired by Smalltalk, is different. Numbers, boolean values, string literals etc. are all objects. You can call methods on them:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-ruby">5.even?                     # => false 
1.upto(4).to_a              # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
"A string literal".length   # => 16</code></pre>

You can list their methods:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-ruby">42.methods
=> [:to_s,
 :inspect,
 :-@,
 :+,
 :-,
 :*,
 :/,
 :div,
 :%,
...
</code></pre>

You can also check their class:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-ruby">1.class     # => Fixnum
1.3.class   # => Float
true.class  # => TrueClass
</code></pre>

What might be suprising at first if youâ€™re new to Ruby, is that classes are objects too! They are instances of the class Class:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-ruby">
Fixnum.is_a?(Object)  # => true
Fixnum.class          # => Class
</code></pre>

We can inspect the inheritance hierarchy of Class using ancestors method:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code>Class.ancestors   # => [Class, Module, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]</code></pre>

So, does it all mean that really everything is an object? Well, even in Ruby there are some exceptions. Perhaps the most notable are methods and blocks. They are not objects themselves, but they can be wrapped by one (Proc).

<h3>Metaprogramming</h3>

Metaprogramming is a technique that allows programs to manipulate themselves or another programs at a runtime. In other words, metaprogramming makes it possible to write programs that write programs. Thanks to its dynamic nature and expressive syntax, Rubyâ€™s metaprogramming capabilities are truly astounding. With these techniques we can write programs that are cleaner and easier to mantain. Here are some examples of things we can do in Ruby:

<h3>Singleton methods</h3>

Ruby allows you to define a method, that is available only for a specific object. We call these methods singleton methods. When you add such method to an object, it can be invoked only from this particular object. Other instances of the same class canâ€™t access it. Letâ€™s see it in action:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-ruby">
object = Object.new           # => #<Object:0x00000001671b68> 
my_object = Object.new        # => #<Object:0x0000000168b9a0> 

def my_object.custom_method
  "Singleton method called"
end

my_object.custom_method       # => "Singleton method called" 
object.custom_method          # => NameError: undefined local variable or method `object' for main:Object
</code></pre>

In the above example we created two instances of class Object. Next, weâ€™ve added a method, called custom_method to one of them - my_object. Finally, we verified that the method is indeed available only for the object it was defined for. The other instance throws an exception when we try to invoke custom_method on it.

<h3>method_missing</h3>

Ruby gives you a way of handling calls to methods that donâ€™t really exist. To understand how it works, letâ€™s first have a look at the method lookup path. When object receives a message, Ruby searches for a right method in the following order:

singleton class
class
modules (starting from the one included last)
superclass
superclassâ€™ modules
repeating steps 4 and 5 until the BasicObject (or Object, for Ruby versions below 1.9) is reached
If the invoked method canâ€™t be found, the dispatch starts again. This time, however, it looks for a special method, called method_missing. Once itâ€™s found, the method_missing is called with following arguments:

original method name
parameters passed to originally called method
block passed to the original method
Letâ€™s see it in action:

class A
  def method_missing(method, *args, &amp;block)
    "method_missing captured a call to #{method} with arguments: #{args.join(', ')}"
  end
end

obj = A.new

obj.random_method(1, 'abc', true)

<h1>=> "method_missing captured a call to random_method with arguments: 1, abc, true"</h1>

This technique allows you to â€˜createâ€™ methods dynamically. An example of method_missing usage in practice can be (now deprecated) Rails dynamic finders, such as find_by_name`.

<h3>Writing code dynamically</h3>

Itâ€™s possible to write a code that writes code. For example, imagine that you need your object to have a few methods that have a very similar behavior. You can create these methods using define_method:

class A
  METHOD_NAMES = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl', 'mno']

METHOD_NAMES.each do |name|
    define_method(name) do |arg|
      "Called method #{name} with argument: #{arg}"
    end
  end
end

obj = A.new
obj.abc(42)        # => "Called method abc with argument: 42"
obj.mno('arg')     # => "Called method mno with argument: arg"

<h3>Note about risks</h3>

Metaprogrammin adds great flexibility to the language. It allows us to write more with less code. It can help in reducing repetition or just writing cleaner and more concise code. We canâ€™t, however, forget that all these posiibilities come at a certain cost. With great power comes great responsibility. While properly used metaprogramming techniques can save you much effort, overusing them can give the opposite results. You might end up with a code that is complex and difficult to debug. Use above techniques with care!

<h3>Modules</h3>

Rubyâ€™s modules are perhaps one of the languageâ€™s most powerful features. They allow to modify class hierarchy dynamically at runtime. Letâ€™s create a very simple module M:

module M
  def mod_method
    "Module method invoked"
  end
end
Module methods can be mixed in as a class methods, using extend keyword:

class A
  extend M
end

A.mod_method    # => "Module method invoked"
or as instance methods, with include keyword:

class B
  include M
end

B.new.mod_method    # => "Module method invoked"
Mixins are very clean and elegant equivalents of multiple inheritance or traits found in another languages.

<h3>Blocks, Procs and lambdas</h3>

Blocks in Ruby are, in simple terms, a chunks of code grouped together by enclosing braces or a pair of do-end keywords. They can be passed to methods, which can call a block using yield statement. When the block is passed to method, itâ€™s not executed immediately. Instead, the context in which it was encountered by Ruby interpreter is remembered (self, local variables etc.). When itâ€™s then called from within the method, it is executed in that context. This concept is called closure in computer science. Letâ€™s see a live example:

var = "something"

def meth
  var = "something else"
  yield
end

meth { puts var }   # => "something"
Passing blocks to methods is a very common practice in Ruby. For example, itâ€™s the most typical way of iterating over collections.

squares = [1, 2, 3].map{|i| i**2}         # => [1, 4, 9]

even = [1,2,3,4,5,6].select{|i| i.even?}  # => [2, 4, 6]
This syntax feels very natural and is extremely expressive.

So far weâ€™ve been passing anonymous blocks to the methods when they were called. While itâ€™s a very useful and simple technique, there are times where it would be more convenient to store the block in a variable and be able to reuse it later. Ruby has a feature that allows you to do just that. You can wrap your blocks of code into Proc, making it first-class object.

square = Proc.new do |i|
  i**2
end

class Array
  def iterate(my_proc)
    self.each_with_index do |element, index|
      self[index] = my_proc.call(element)
    end
  end
end

[1, 2, 3, 4].call(square)    # => [1, 4, 9, 16]
Thereâ€™s one more construct in Ruby that is very similar to Proc. Itâ€™s called lambda. Letâ€™s first look at the usage of lambda and then talk about how itâ€™s different from Proc

square_lambda = lambda{|i| i**2}

class Array
  def iterate(my_proc)
    self.each_with_index do |element, index|
      self[index] = my_proc.call(element)
    end
  end
end

[1, 2, 3, 4].call(square_lambda)    # => [1, 4, 9, 16]
As you can see, lambas can be used in pretty much the same way as Procs. There are, however, two main differences. First, Procs donâ€™t check the number of arguments passed, while lambdas do.

print_numbers_proc = Proc.new {|a, b| "Your numbers are: #{a} and #{b}"}
print_numbers_lambda = lambda {|a, b| "Your numbers are: #{a} and #{b}"}

print_numbers_proc.call(1,2)     # => "Your numbers are: 1 and 2"
print_numbers_proc.call(1)       # => "Your numbers are: 1 and "

print_numbers_lambda.call(1,2)   # => "Your numbers are: 1 and 2"
print_numbers_lambda.call(1)     # => ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
The second difference is in the way return works in both of them. If you execute lambda containing return instruction from within a method, execution flow will be continued from the line right after the lambda was called. In case of Proc, return will finish execution of the outer method. As always, letâ€™s see an example:

def test_lambda_return
  lambda {
    return "inside lambda"
  }.call
  return "inside test_lambda_return method"
end

def test_proc_return
  Proc.new {
    return "inside Proc"
  }.call
  return "inside test_proc_return method"
end

test_lambda_return     #=> "inside test_lambda_return method"
test_proc_return       #=> "inside Proc"

<h3>Emphasis on testing</h3>

Ruby community puts large emphasis on using methodologies that are supposed to ensure good code quality. Perhaps the most popular of such development processes is Test Driven Development, or TDD in short. One of the best resources for people who start to learn ruby is RubyKoans. It teaches you Ruby by writing tests, so by the time you become proficient in writing Ruby code, you also know how to test it.

The emphasis on testing can also be seen in abundance of tools designed for this purpose. Most popular testing frameworks include RSpec, Minitest and Test::Unit. For mocking you can use Rspec-mocks or Mocha. Simulating a browser is possible with Capybara or Webrat. And thatâ€™s just a tip of the iceberg.

<h3>Libraries</h3>

The power of a language lies not only within the language itself, but also the community built around it. Ruby has a thriving community, that creates a lot of great open-source libraries distributed as gems.

The most popular Ruby-based library, and also the one that contributed greatly to its popularity, is of course Rails. However, itâ€™s not the only web framework written in Ruby. Two other most notable examples are Sinatra and Padrino. More exhaustive list of Ruby web frameworks can be found here.

What if youâ€™re not looking for a web framework, but and ORM library? You can choose from ActiveRecord, Sequel, DataMapper or Squeel.

Need background jobs in your app? Have a look at Resque, Delayed Job or sidekiq.

The list could go on and on.

Whatever youâ€™re looking for, thareâ€™s a good chance that thereâ€™s already at least one library that will help you solve your problem with ease.

When you find the gem you would like to use in your project, installation is also a breeze. Either run gem install gem_name, or add the gem to you Gemfile and run bundle install command, if youâ€™re using Bundler. It doesnâ€™t get any simpler than this!

<h3>Syntax</h3>

Last but not least, one of the things I love about Ruby is its syntax. Itâ€™s elegant and feels very natural. Blocks, implicit return and dynamic typing result in uncluttered, clean and expressive code. A great thing about Ruby syntax is multitude of syntactic sugar - construct that serve a purpose of making the code easier and faster to write and read, while not necessarily following normal rules.

Below I listed a couple of interesting Ruby syntax elements:

common usage of blocks
optional return statements - last statement value in a method is returned by default
shorthand for one line conditional statements
do_something if condition
instead of

if condition
  do_something
end
multiple assignment
def my_method(*args)
  first_name, last_name = args
end

my_method('Han', 'Solo')
one line rescue - you can use rescue statement after single line instruction to provide return value in case an exception is thrown
arr.count rescue 0
optional brackets in method calls - help in writing code that reads more like natural language

convention naming rules for different variable types allow you to know the variableâ€™s scope just by looking at its name

local_variable
@instance_variable
@@class_variable
$global_variable

<h2>Development environment</h2>

Considering various idiosyncratic customizations, there are probably as many development environments as there are Rails programmers. To avoid this com-plexity, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial standardizes on the excellent cloud develop-ment environment <a href="http://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a>. In particular, for this third edition I am pleased to partner with Cloud9 to offer a development environment specifically tailored to the needs of this tutorial. The resulting Rails Tutorial Cloud9 workspace comes pre-configured with most of the software needed for professional-grade Rails development, including Ruby, RubyGems, Git. (Indeed, the only big piece of software weâ€™ll install separately is Rails itself, and this is intentional (Section 1.2.2).) The cloud IDE also includes the three essential components needed to develop web applications: a text editor, a filesystem navigator, and a command-line terminal (Figure 1.1). Among other features, the cloud IDE text editor supports the â€œFind in Filesâ€ global search that I consider essential to nav-igating any large Ruby or Rails project. 6 Finally, even if you decide not to use the cloud IDE exclusively in real life (and I certainly recommend learning other tools as well), it provides an excellent introduction to the general capabilities of text editors and other development tools.

Here are the steps for getting started with the cloud development environ-ment:

<ol>
<li>Sign up for a free account at Cloud9</li>
<li>Click on â€œGo to your Dashboardâ€</li>
<li>Select â€œCreate New Workspaceâ€</li>
<li>As shown in Figure 1.2, create a workspace called â€œrails-tutorialâ€ (not â€œrails_tutorialâ€), set it to â€œPrivate to the people I inviteâ€, and select the icon for the Rails Tutorial (not the icon for Ruby on Rails)</li>
<li>Click â€œCreateâ€</li>
<li>After Cloud9 has finished provisioning the workspace, select it and click â€œStart editingâ€</li>
</ol>

Because using two spaces for indentation is a near-universal convention in Ruby, I also recommend changing the editor to use two spaces instead of the default four. As shown in Figure 1.3, you can do this by clicking the gear icon in the upper right and then selecting â€œCode Editor (Ace)â€ to edit the â€œSoft Tabsâ€ setting.

On of the downsides of the way php handles variables is that there is no way to ensure that any one of them will exist at any given point in the excutions of a script. This can introduce a range of problems -from annoying warnings, if you try to output the value of a non-existents variable, to significant security and functionality issues when variables are unexpectedly unavailable when you need them.

To mitigate this problem, you can use the special construct isset();

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">if (isset($)) {
// Do something if $x is set
} elseif (!isset($x)) {
// Do something if $x is not set
}</code></pre>

A call to <code>isset()</code> will return <code>true</code> if a variable exists and has a value other than <code>NULL</code>.

<h3>Determining If a Variable is Empty</h3>

In addition to isset(), PHP also has another special construct: empty().
empty() will return true if the value passed to it is NULL, or any value that can be coered to false, including an empty string, an empty array, integer zero, and string "0".

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">
$variable = "0";
if (empty($variable)) {
// True
}
</code>
</pre>

Prior to PHP 5.5, empty() only accepted variables for its argument; from PHP 5.5, it will accept any valid expression

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">
if (empty(someFunction())) {
...
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Constants</h3>

Conversely to variables, constants are meant for defining immutable values. Constants can be accessed for any scope within a script: however, they can only contain scalar values. Constant names, like variables, are case-sensitive; they also follow the same naming requirements, with the exception of the leading $. It is considered best practice to define constants using only upper-case names.

Here's an example of constants at work:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">
define('EMAIL', 'hello@scriptsvn.com'); // Valid name
echo EMAIL; // Display: 'hello@scriptsvn.com'

define('USE_XML', true);
if (USE_XML) {} // Evalutes to true

define('1CONSTANT', 'some value'); Invalid name

</code>
</pre>

From PHP 5.3 you can also use the const keyword to define constants:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">
const EMAIL = 'hello@scriptsvn.com';
echo EMAIL;
</code>
</pre>

Also, from PHP 5.6 you can use constant scalar expressions to define the value:

<pre class="codeblock js-code-is-hidden"><code class="language-php">
const DOMAIN = "scriptsvn.com";
const EMAIL = "hello@".DOMAIN;
</code>
</pre>

Constant scalr expressions support any valid expression that only uses static scalar values such as:

<ul>
<li>Integers, Floats and Strings</li>
<li>Magic constants such ass <strong>LINE</strong>, <strong>FILE</strong>, <strong>DIR</strong>, and <strong>METHOD</strong></li>
<li>Heredoc (without variables) and Nowdoc strings</li>
<li>Other constants</li>
</ul>

Valid expression include:

<ul>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Bitwise Math</li>
<li>Boolean Logic</li>
<li>Concatenation</li>
<li>Ternary</li>
<li>Comparions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operators</h3>

As their name subtly suggests, operators are the catalysts of operations. There are many types of operators in PHP; those most commonly used are:

<ul>
<li>Assignment Operators for assigning data to variables</li>
<li>Arithmetic Operators for performing basic math functions</li>
<li>String Operators for joining two or more strings</li>
<li>Comparison Operators for comparing two pieces of data</li>
<li>Logical Operators for performing logical operations on boolean values</li>
</ul>

In addition, PHP also provides:

<ul>
<li>Bitwise Operators for manipulating bits using boolean math</li>
<li>Error Control Operators for suppressing errors</li>
<li>Execution Operators for executing system commands</li>
<li>Incrementing/ Decrementing Operators for adding to and subtracting from numerical values</li>
<li>Type Operators for identifying Objects</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>With very few excerptions, PHP's operations are binary-meaning that they require two operands. All binary operations use an infix notation, in wich the operator sits in between its operands (for example, 2 + 2).</blockquote>";s:10:"post_title";s:40:"Variables constants and Operators in PHP";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:32:"determining-if-a-variable-exists";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2015-10-19 03:19:19";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2015-10-19 03:19:19";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:26:"http://scriptsvn.com/?p=59";s:10:"menu_order";s:2:"17";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:42;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:2:"55";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2015-10-08 07:10:00";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2015-10-08 07:10:00";s:12:"post_content";s:32432:"AngularJS is an amazing JavaScript framework for building rich client-side applications but the truth is many developers donâ€™t use the built-in router. They instead use the AngularUI projectâ€™s UI-Router because it has two important features: multiple views and nested views. This article explains these features and why they are important and shows you a real-world example of using these features together.<!--more-->

<h2>Why You Should Use UI-Router</h2>

<h3>Multiple Views</h3>

Most applications can be broken up into regions. At a minimum, applications usually have a header, a main content area, and a footer.

Commonly, applications may have an additional sidebar on the left or right side of the page as shown below.

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/multiple-views-sketch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/multiple-views-sketch.jpg" alt="multiple-views-sketch" width="2048" height="1536" /></a>

In most use cases, all of these regions (views) are shown on the page at the same time. With the built-in AngularJS router, <code>ngRoute</code>, only one view (<code>ng-view</code>) is allowed per page. This limitation causes people to use includes (ng-include) or other workarounds to create a layout or master page for their application. UI-Router supports multiple views and each can have itâ€™s own corresponding Controller so that each of these regions can be encapsulated and reused throughout the application if needed.

<h3>Nested Views</h3>

The common example of a nested view in applications is a master/detail or, more specifically, a list/detail page. Many applications show a list of items then when you click on an item you see the detail for that item. Taking this example further, you might then click an edit link when viewing the itemâ€™s details that takes you to an editable form for the item (see the diagram below to visualize).

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/master-detail-sketch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/master-detail-sketch.jpg" alt="master-detail-sketch" width="2048" height="1536" /></a>

This scenario is easily achieved with the built-in AngularJS router, <code>ngRoute</code>, if the list and detail are on separate pages (or views as they are called in AngularJS). However, if you want the list to remain on the page while you show the detail to the right or below the list this becomes more challenging. To be clear, this requirement can be achieved with <code>ngRoute</code> by sharing a single view with two controllers: one for the list and one for the detail and hiding and showing the detail as needed. The result is not ideal because we would like the list and detail to each have their own controller and view with only one responsibility (showing a list or showing item details). By encapsulating these user interface areas in their own view we can have a more composable UI that allows us to bring the pieces together or break them apart as needed to meet requirements. Nested views enable us to not only bring these views together at the same time but also to nest a view inside another view as is done in the list/detail example.

<h2>History</h2>

When AngularJS was first released <code>ngRoute</code> had a similar feature set as other routers at the time, such as the router included in the Backbone.js library as well as the stand-alone routing libraries History.js and Sammy.js. In summary, they mapped a route or URL to JavaScript code that needed to be run when the URL changes and added entries to the browsers history appropriately so that the back button didnâ€™t break.

Eventually competing JavaScript MV* frameworks like Ember.js and Durandal.js innovated and came out with more robust routers that supported multiple views and nested views and implemented the state machine design pattern internally.

AngularJS responded to this by removing <code>ngRoute</code> out of the core angular.js download in version 1.1.6 (most people just say version 1.2). It is still available for download from the<a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS site</a> but is no longer in the core.

The AngularJS community responded and the most popular library that emerged was the AngularUI projectâ€™s UI-Router.

The AngularJS team which for several months (as a consultant) included Rob Eisenberg, the Durandal.js and Aurelia (nextgen Durandal) creator, has been working on a rewrite of the Router for the future version of AngularJS 2.0 and have stated it will eventually be ported back into a point release of AngularJS version 1.3 which was just recently released.

If you want more details about the history and the pros and cons of various routers the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3UC0RrgCh9CKrLxeE4sxwmNSBl3oSXQGt9g3KZnTJI/edit#heading=h.xgjl2srtytjt">public design document for the AngularJS 2.0 router is available here</a> Note that youâ€™ll need to click the green button labeled â€œsuggestingâ€ and choose â€œviewingâ€ as shown below to make it legible.

download the <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js">release</a> or <a href="https://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.min.js">minified</a> versions

<h4>bower install</h4>

<pre><code>$ bower install angular-ui-router
</code></pre>

<h4>npm install</h4>

<pre><code>$ bower install angular-ui-router
</code></pre>

<h3>Include script tag</h3>

Include angular-ui-router.js or angular-ui-router.min.js in your index.html, after the Angular script tag (see below)

<pre><code class="language-php"><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.1.5/angular.min.js"></script><script src="js/angular-ui-router.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

<h3>Include Dependency</h3>

Include the â€˜ui.routerâ€™ dependency in your main AngularJS module.

<pre><code class="language-js">var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ui.router']);
</code></pre>

Notice the module name is <code>ui.router</code> not <code>ui-router</code> (using the hyphen is a common mistake).

<h2>Router as State Machine</h2>

UI-Router introduces a state machine design pattern abstraction on top of a traditional router. Routes are referred to as <code>states</code> and the URL becomes simply a property of the state.

<pre><code class=" language-js">var app = angular.module('demo', ['ui.router']);
 
app.config(['$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider', function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/');
 
    $stateProvider
        .state('home', {
            url:'/',
            templateUrl: 'templates/home.html',
            controller: 'HomeController'
        })
        .state('about', {
            url:'/about',
            templateUrl: 'templates/about.html',
            controller: 'AboutController'
        })
 
}]);</code></pre>

When you create links you can simply refer to the <code>state</code> name inside a <code>ui-sref</code> directive instead of using the <code>URL</code>.

So this:

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict"> &lt;a ui-sref="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Renders:

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict"> &lt;a href="#/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

In the example above <code>ui-sref</code> can be understood as follows: <code>ui</code> is the directive prefix for all AngularUI project directives and <code>sref</code> is a play on the traditional <code>href</code> of an HTML anchor tag and stands for state ref.

<h4>In the Controller</h4>

Here is an example of how to do a redirect in a Controller to a <code>state</code>.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascriapt">$scope.redirectToAbout = function(){
    $state.go('about'); 
}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h3>$routeProvider becomes $stateProvider</h3>

The AngularJS service injected to provide routing which is <code>$routeProvider</code> with <code>ngRoute</code>becomes <code>$stateProvider</code> when using the UI-Router.

<h3>$urlRouterProvider</h3>

The <code>$urlRouterProvider</code> is there for two main purposes. To establish a default route for URLs that donâ€™t have a specific route.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">app.config(['$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider', function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/');
    ...
}]);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

To allow developers to listen for a window location change and redirect to a route that has a<code>state</code> defined.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">app.config(['$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider', function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $urlRouterProvider
        .when('/legacy-route', {
            redirectTo: '/'
        });
}]);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

In summary, <code>$urlRouterProvider</code> lets you handle cases where the state machine abstraction of the $stateProvider doesnâ€™t make sense.

So now that youâ€™ve got the basics of the UI-Router lets get back to those features that make it better than <code>ngRoute</code>.

<h2>UI-Router in Action</h2>

We will look at an example of nested views first then weâ€™ll look an example of multiple views. After we get our heads around each weâ€™ll put the two features together to show how they can be used in a real-world application.

<h3>Nested Views with UI-Router</h3>

Here is a list/detail example of nested views using UI-Router. The example displays a list of TV shows.

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-904" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-1.png" alt="angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-1" width="742" height="398" /></a>

If you click on a row youâ€™ll see a detailed description for the selected show.

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-2.png" alt="angularjs-ui-router-nested-views-2" width="778" height="854" /></a>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<h3>Application Shell (index.html)</h3>

AngularJS applications are single-page application where views are inserted into a shell page. Here is our shell page index.html.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html id="data-ng-app" data-ng-app="demo"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;ui router demo&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
            .selected{background-color: #efefef; width:120px; } 
            .detail{width: 300px;margin: 30px;border-top: 1px solid #efefef;}
        &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;!-- IE8-HTML5: https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ --&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/libs/html5shiv.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
Â 
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body id="index"&gt;
Â 
        &lt;!-- Angular UI Router Directive for template insertion --&gt;
        &lt;div id="content" ui-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Â 
        &lt;script src="js/libs/angular.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/libs/underscore.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="js/libs/angular-ui-router.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;        
        &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

The <code>&lt;div id="content" ui-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> will have the first level or parent view (in our example shows.html) placed inside of it by the UI-Router.

<h4>Home page view (templates/shows.html)</h4>

The list view is shows.html.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li ui-sref-active="selected" ng-repeat="show in shows"&gt;
        &lt;a ui-sref="shows.detail({id: show.id})"&gt;{{show.name}}&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Â 
&lt;div class="detail" ui-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

As mentioned before the index.html page has a <code>ui-view</code> attribute directive into which this view (shows.html) is rendered when the corresponding route is requested.

Notice how there is another <code>ui-view</code> nested inside this shows.html view. This <code>ui-view</code> is where a child view of the parent â€˜showsâ€™ view is rendered. In this example shows-detail.html is the child view.

<h4>Shows detail view (templates/shows-detail.html)</h4>

The detail view is shows-detail.html

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;h3&gt;{{selectedShow.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    {{selectedShow.description}}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h3>Controllers</h3>

And there is a corresponding controller for each view.

<h4>ShowsController</h4>

The <code>ShowsController</code> loads an in-memory array of shows from the <code>ShowsService</code>.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">app.controller('ShowsController', ['$scope','ShowsService', function($scope, ShowsService) {
    $scope.shows = ShowsService.list();
 }]);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h4>ShowsDetailController</h4>

The <code>ShowsDetailController</code> looks up the show by id using the <code>ShowsService</code> and sets it as the <code>selectedShow</code> on the <code>$scope</code>.

<pre><code class="language-js">app.controller('ShowsDetailController', ['$scope','$stateParams', 'ShowsService', function($scope, $stateParams, ShowsService) {
        $scope.selectedShow = ShowsService.find($stateParams.id);
 }]);</code></pre>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

We need to configure the UI-Router using the <code>$stateProvider</code>.

When we define a state as <code>'parentstatename.childstatename'</code> the convention of simply adding the period when defining the state name tells UI-Router that the child state is nested under the parent state.

<pre><code class="language-js"> app.config(['$stateProvider', '$urlRouterProvider', function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {
    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/shows');
Â 
    $stateProvider
        .state('shows', {
            url:'/shows',
            templateUrl: 'templates/shows.html',
            controller: 'ShowsController'
        })
        .state('shows.detail', {
            url: '/detail/:id',
            templateUrl: 'templates/shows-detail.html',
            controller: 'ShowsDetailController'
        });
}]);</code></pre>

What is really great about nested views is that the list controller just has implementation details regarding the list and the detail controller is only concerned with showing details.

To show how decoupled these are we only need to change the routing configuration to not nest the details and we have two separate virtual pages (one for list and one for details). More specifically, weâ€™ll change the state name <code>'shows.detail'</code> to <code>'detail'</code>.

<pre><code class="language-js line-numbers">$stateProvider
    .state('shows', {
        url:'/shows',
        templateUrl: 'templates/shows.html',
        controller: 'ShowsController'
    })
    .state('detail', {
        url: '/detail/:id',
        templateUrl: 'templates/shows-detail.html',
        controller: 'ShowsDetailController'
    });
    ...</code></pre>

And change the link to the state from <code>&lt;a ui-sref="shows.detail({id: show.id})"&gt;{{show.name}}&lt;/a&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;a ui-sref="detail({id: show.id})"&gt;{{show.name}}&lt;/a&gt;</code>

Now our example will display the views separately as if they are two separate pages.

<h3>Service</h3>

The <code>ShowsService</code> is our data access layer in this example and just keeps an in-memory array and uses underscore.js to easily work with the collection.

<pre><code class="language-js">app.factory('ShowsService',function(){
    var shows = [{
        id: 1,
        name: 'Walking Dead',
        description: 'The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It stars Andrew Lincoln as sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma to find a post-apocalyptic world dominated by flesh-eating zombies.'
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Breaking Bad',
        description: 'Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show originally aired on the AMC network for five seasons, from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013. The main character is Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series.'   
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name: '7D', 
        description: 'The 7D is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation, and broadcast on Disney XD starting in July 7, 2014. It is a re-imagining of the titular characters from the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by Walt Disney Productions'
    }];
 
 
    return {
        list: function(){
            return shows;
        },
        find: function(id){
            return _.find(shows, function(show){return show.id == id});
        }
    }
 });
</code></pre>

<h3>Multiple Views with UI-Router</h3>

Below is an example of several regions on a page including a header, content, and footer being managed on a page with UI-Router using multiple views.

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-901" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-1.png" alt="angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-1" width="652" height="452" /></a>

There is some primary navigation and various content is filled into the regions depending on the virtual page the user navigates to in the application.

<a href="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-902" src="http://www.funnyant.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-2.png" alt="angularjs-ui-router-multiple-views-2" width="718" height="466" /></a>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<h4>Application Shell (index.html)</h4>

<pre><code class="language-html"><!DOCTYPE html>
 <html class="no-js">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <title>Index</title>
        <meta name="description" content="">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
 
 
    </head>
    <body ng-app="demo">
 
       <div ui-view="header"></div>
       <div ui-view="content"></div>
       <div ui-view="footer"></div>
 
    <script src="/js/bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/bower_components/angular-ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js"></script>
    <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
 
    </body>
</html>
</code></pre>

Notice the <code>ui-view</code> attribute directives have names assigned to them: header, content, and footer. These names are referenced when we configure the router to say which view/template and controller to use for each region of the page.

<h4>Templates/Views</h4>

The templates are straight-forward to keep the example simple. Header.html has some navigation that uses the <code>ui-sref</code> directive to navigate to various application states/routes.

<h4>partials/header.html</h4>

<code>wp_content()</code> and <code>wp_footer()</code>,

<pre><code><div class="ul"><li><a ng-href="/">Home</a></li><li ui-sref-active="active"><a ui-sref="dashboard">Dashboard</a></li><li ui-sref-active="active"><a ui-sref="campaigns">Campaigns</a></li></div></code></pre>

<h4>partials/content.html</h4>

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;p&gt;This is the default content.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h4>partials/footer.html</h4>

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;p&gt;This is the footer.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h4>partials/dashboard.html</h4>

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;h2&gt;Dashboard&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h4>partials/campaigns.html</h4>

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;h2&gt;Campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

The dashboard and campaigns view templates are used to replace the default content in content.html when the corresponding routes are requested.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

As in the previous example we use the $stateProvider to configure the states (routes).

The key takeaway below is to notice that instead of having one <code>templateUrl</code> and<code>controller</code> per <code>URL</code> you instead have a collection of <code>views</code> each with its own<code>templateUrl</code> and <code>controller.</code>

So this:

<pre><code class="javascript">.state('home',{
        url: '/',
        templateUrl: '/templates/partials/header.html',
        controller: 'HomeController'
    })</code></pre>

Becomes:

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">.state('home',{
        url: '/',
        views: {
            'header': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/header.html',
                controller: 'HeaderController'
            },
            'content': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/content.html',
                controller: 'ContentController' 
            },
            'footer': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/footer.html',
                controller: 'FooterController'
            }
        }
    })</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Here is the full code for the example (note: controllers are not needed for the example I just put them in above for completeness).

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">var app = angular.module('demo', ['ui.router']);
Â 
app.config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider){
Â 
    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/');
Â 
    $stateProvider
    .state('home',{
        url: '/',
        views: {
            'header': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/header.html'
            },
            'content': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/content.html' 
            },
            'footer': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/footer.html'
            }
        }
    })
Â 
    .state('dashboard', {
        url: '/dashboard',
        views: {
            'header': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/header.html'
            },
            'content': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/dashboard.html',
                controller: 'DashboardController'
            }
        }
Â 
    })
Â 
    .state('campaigns', {
        url: '/campaigns',
        views: {
            'content': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/campaigns.html',
                controller: 'CampaignController'
            },
            'footer': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/footer.html'
            }
        }
Â 
    })
});</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

The other thing to notice is that if I donâ€™t fill in a region with a view then it will not be shown when the user navigates to that route. This is not ideal and makes us repeat ourselves quite a bit so in the next section we will look at how to remove this repetition by using the nested views we saw earlier.

<h3>Multiple Views and Nested View with UI-Router</h3>

Now that we understand each of these powerful features lets bring them together to give you a better idea of how you might want to set-up a real-world application.

<h4>Configuration</h4>

Weâ€™ll start with the configuration since the view templates are the same as in the multiple views example.

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="javascript">var app = angular.module('demo', ['ui.router']);
Â 
app.config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider){
Â 
    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/');
Â 
    $stateProvider
    .state('app',{
        url: '/',
        views: {
            'header': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/header.html'
            },
            'content': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/content.html' 
            },
            'footer': {
                templateUrl: '/templates/partials/footer.html'
            }
        }
    })
Â 
    .state('app.dashboard', {
        url: 'dashboard',
        views: {
            'content@': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/dashboard.html',
                controller: 'DashboardController'
            }
        }
Â 
    })
Â 
    .state('app.campaigns', {
        url: 'campaigns',
        views: {
            'content@': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/campaigns.html',
                controller: 'CampaignController'
            }
        }
Â 
    })
Â 
    .state('app.subscribers', {
        url: 'subscribers',
        views: {
            'content@': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/subscribers.html',
                controller: 'SubscriberController'      
            }
        }
Â 
    })
    .state('app.subscribers.detail', {
        url: '/:id',
        /*
        templateUrl: 'templates/partials/subscriber-detail.html',
        controller: 'SubscriberDetailController'
        */
Â 
        views: {
            'detail@app.subscribers': {
                templateUrl: 'templates/partials/subscriber-detail.html',

We create a default state (route) at <code>/</code> named <code>app</code>. In this <code>app</code> state we can define the default content for our header and footer regions. Then if we make every other page in the application a nested view under the <code>app</code> by using the dot syntax for example <code>app.campaigns</code>. Notice we only need to replace the <code>content</code> region (<code>ui-view='content'</code>) unless we need to change the header or footer because these views are nested under the default app state.

<h3>State names</h3>

The most difficult concept to grasp in the code above is the state
name syntax with the <code>@</code> in the middle. The syntax for the state name can be explained as follows:

Two questions need to be answered when writing a state-name:

<ol>
    <li>What is the name of the view (region) I want to replace with my template when this route is requested: view-name? More specifically, this is the value of the ui-view attribute directives. Here are some examples of ui-view directives and their corresponding view-name:
<ul>
    <li><code>ui-view='content'</code> = content</li>
    <li><code>ui-view='header'</code> = header</li>
    <li><code>ui-view='footer'</code> = footer</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Where can I find the ui-view with that view-name?
<ul>
    <li>this location is not expressed as a templateUrl but instead as the state that contains that template</li>
    <li>when the template ui-view with the view-name is in the application shell template (index.html) because index.html is not defined in any state you should leave name the state as empty string (â€) or nothing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Putting this together, the syntax is <code>question1@question2</code> or more specifically <code>view-name@state-name</code>.

So if you need to find the content view-name in index.html it would be:
<code>'content@'</code>

<ul>
    <li>See the second bullet under #2 about leaving the state blank when the view-name is in the shell page (index.html).</li>
</ul>

If you need to find the content view-name in subscribers.html it would be:
<code>'detail@app.subscribers'</code>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<h4>Application Shell (index.html)</h4>

The shell page doesnâ€™t change from the previous example and simply defines named views for each region of the page: header, footer, and content.

<h4>Views/Templates</h4>

<h4>Header (partials/header.html)</h4>

The header has updated <code>ui-sref</code> references to the nested states for example <code>.campaigns</code>with the period not <code>campaigns</code>. Note the parent state is inferred when we say <code>.campaigns</code>.

<code>

<div class="ul">
    <li><a ng-href="/">Home</a></li>    
    <li ui-sref-active="active"><a ui-sref=".dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
    <li ui-sref-active="active"><a ui-sref=".campaigns">Campaigns</a></li>
    <li ui-sref-active="active"><a ui-sref=".subscribers">Subscribers</a></li>
</div>

</code>

<div class="wp_syntax">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;div class="ul"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a ng-href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;    
    &lt;li ui-sref-active="active"&gt;&lt;a ui-sref=".dashboard"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li ui-sref-active="active"&gt;&lt;a ui-sref=".campaigns"&gt;Campaigns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li ui-sref-active="active"&gt;&lt;a ui-sref=".subscribers"&gt;Subscribers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Below are the other new subscriber templates in the example.

<h4>partials/subscribers.html</h4>

<tr class="alt-table-row">
<td class="code">
<pre class="html4strict">&lt;h2&gt;Subscribers&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;li ng-repeat="subscriber in subscribers"&gt;
Â 
        &lt;a ui-sref=".detail({id: subscriber.id})" &gt; {{subscriber.name}}&lt;/a&gt;
        {{subscriber.email}}
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Â 
&lt;div ui-view="detail"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The syntax for the state names is difficult to grasp but the benefits of having a robust router which allows you to compose your user interface from well encapsulated view/controller pairs is worth it in my mind. So please feel free to take the last example as a starting point for the shell of your application and run with it to build an amazing and much more maintainable application.

The last time I seriously upgraded my PC was in 2011, because the PC is over. And in some ways, it truly is â€“ they can slap a ton more CPU cores on a die, for sure, but the overall single core performance increase from a 2011 high end Intel CPU to today's high end Intel CPU is â€¦ really quite modest, on the order of maybe 30% to 40%.

In that same timespan, mobile and tablet CPU performance has continued to just about double every year. Which means the forthcoming iPhone 6s will be almost <strong>10 times faster</strong> than the iPhone 4 was.

<img title="" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/09/geekbench-single-core-iphone-results.png" alt="iPhone single core geekbench results" />

Remember, that's only single core CPU performance â€“ I'm not even factoring in the move from single, to dual, to triple core as well as generally faster memory and storage. This stuff is old hat on desktop, where we've had mainstream dual cores for a decade now, but they are <em>huge</em> improvements for mobile.

When your mobile devices get 10 times faster in the span of four years, it's hard to muster much enthusiasm for a modest 1.3 Ã— or 1.4 Ã— iterative improvement in your PC's performance over the same time.

I've been slogging away at this for a while; my current PC build series spans 7 years:
<ul>
	<li>Building a PC, Part VII: Rebooting</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part VI: Rebuilding</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part V: Upgrading</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part IV: Now It's Your Turn</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part III: Overclocking</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part II: Burn in</li>
	<li>Building a PC, Part I: Minimal boot</li>
</ul>
The fun part of building a PC is that it's relatively easy to swap out the guts when something compelling comes along. CPU performance improvements may be modest these days, but there are still bright spots where performance is increasing more dramatically. Mainly in graphics hardware and, in this case, <strong>storage</strong>.

The current latest-and-greatest Intel CPU is Skylake. Like Sandy Bridge in 2011, which brought us much faster 6 Gbps SSD-friendly drive connectors (although only two of them), the Skylake platform brings us another key storage improvement â€“ the ability to connect hard drives directly to the PCI Express lanes. Which looks like this:

<img title="" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/09/m2-drive-on-mobo.jpg" alt="" />

â€¦ and performs like this:

<img title="" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/09/Ars-Technica-Skylake-Review-Charts-012.png" alt="" />

<strong>Now <em>there's</em> the 3Ã— performance increase we've been itching for!</strong> To be fair, a raw increase of 3Ã— in drive performance doesn't necessarily equate to a computer that boots in one third the time. But here's why disk speed matters:
<blockquote>If the CPU registers are how long it takes you to fetch data from your brain, thengoing to disk is the equivalent of fetching data from Pluto.</blockquote>
What I've always loved about SSDs is that they attack the <strong>PC's worst-case performance scenario</strong>, when information has to come off the slowest device inside your computer â€“ the hard drive. SSDs massively reduced the variability of requests for data. Let's compare L1 cache access time to minimum disk access time:
<blockquote>Traditional hard drive
0.9 ns â†’ 10 ms (variability of 11,111,111Ã— )

SSD
0.9 ns â†’ 150 Âµs (variability of 166,667Ã— )</blockquote>
SSDs provide a reduction in overall performance variability of 66Ã—! And when comparing latency:
<blockquote>7200rpm HDD â€” 1800ms
SATA SSD â€” 4ms
PCIe SSD â€” 0.34ms</blockquote>
Even going from a fast SATA SSD to a PCI Express SSD, you're looking at a 10x reduction in drive latency.

Here's what you need:
<ul>
	<li>256GB Samsung SM951 M.2 drive $213</li>
	<li>Asus Z170-A motherboard $165</li>
	<li>Intel i5-i6600k Skylake CPU $270</li>
	<li>16GB DDR4 memory $134</li>
</ul>
These are the basics. It's best to use the M.2 connection as a fast boot / system drive, so I scaled it back to the smaller 256 GB version. I also had a lot of trouble getting my hands on the faster i7-6700k CPU, which appears supply constrained and is currently overpriced as a result.

Even though the days of doubling (or even 1.5Ã—-ing) CPU performance are long gone for PCs, there are still some key iterative performance milestones to hit. Like mainstream 4k displays, I believe mainstream PCI express SSDs are another important step in the overall evolution of desktop computing.

<p>We will be recreating this mockup below (by talented designer <a href="https://dribbble.com/thebuddyman">Thomas Budiman</a>) to demonstrate how using both a modular type scale and a vertical rhythm can provide a systematic way of laying out content in your projects, without having to use magic numbers.</p>

<h2>Modular Type Scales</h2>
<p>Choosing a modular type scale answers the question, &#8220;Which font sizes should I use in this project/design?&#8221; It provides you a set of proportional values to set the varying sizes of text used throughout a consistent design. From the <a href="http://webtypography.net/">Elements of Typographic Style</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A modular scale, like a musical scale, is a prearranged set of harmonious proportions. &#8211; Robert Bringhurst</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many tools that can be used to choose a modular scale, some of which can even be easily used with Sass:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.modularscale.com">Modular Scale</a> (has a Sass plugin)</li>
<li><a href="http://type-scale.com">Type-Scale</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gridlover.net">Grid Lover</a> (provides Sass variables)</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing a modular scale is up to you and/or your designer(s). Sometimes, the chosen scale will be slightly changed to use discretionary values (or rounded values), and that&#8217;s okay. The point is to <strong>choose a type scale and stick with it</strong> throughout the project.</p>
<p>For the example, I&#8217;ve chosen a scale based on <code>1rem</code> with a ratio of <code>1.333</code> (4:3, or a perfect fourth). Each value of the scale can be represented in a Sass map:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
$type-scale: (
  -1: 0.75rem,  // small text
  0: 1rem,      // body text
  1: 1.333rem,  // large text
  2: 1.777rem   // main heading
);
</code></pre>
<p>The map keys represent the <em>power of the ratio</em>; e.g. 1rem * 1.333<sup>2</sup> = 1.777rem. You can also have the map keys represent the semantic meaning of each value, such as <code>small: 0.75rem</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use these values (with a small helper function) to start the typographical styles of this design:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
@function type-scale($level) {
  @return map-get($type-scale, $level);
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Baseline Grids and Vertical Rhythm</h2>
<p>When you saw the above design, did you ask yourself, &#8220;How am I supposed to know exactly where all the items go vertically?&#8221; Turns out, designers frequently use what&#8217;s called a <em>baseline grid</em> to properly layout elements and to provide consistency in design. It is a repeating set of vertical guides where the baseline of text can be aligned to, but it&#8217;s not limited to just typography. Baseline grids are very useful for aligning other visual elements, such as buttons, and even for overall content layout.</p>
<p>The distance between baselines is known as <strong>line height</strong> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading">leading</a>. Because we want the line height to be consistent regardless of font size, we&#8217;ll be using <em>unit values</em> to ensure this*. One way to determine each font size&#8217;s respective line height is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the <strong>base line height</strong>, which is a ratio (usually between 1.2 and 1.5) multiplied by the base font size. E.g. <code>1.25 * 1rem = 1.25rem</code>.</li>
<li>Use a <em>multiple</em> of the base line height for each font size, typically closest to (but larger than) the font size. E.g. for <code>1.777rem</code>, a line-height of <code>1.25rem * 2 = 2.5rem</code> is appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
$base-font-size: 1rem;
$base-line-height: $base-font-size * 1.25;

$line-heights: (
  -1: $base-line-height,
  0: $base-line-height,
  1: $base-line-height * 2,
  2: $base-line-height * 2
);

// Again, we can make a helper function:
@function line-height($level) {
  @return map-get($line-height, $level);
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Common wisdom in CSS is to <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/">use a unitless number</a> for the value of <code>line-height</code> to avoid unwanted line-height cascading for nested elements containing text. However, in this system, <em>all elements containing text</em> should/will have an explicit line height set, so they won&#8217;t be influenced by the cascade.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Vertical Rhythm for Layout</h2>
<p>Of course, not all of the content in a design will be text. The calculated line height can be used in layout for determining vertical padding or margins, so that other elements are also aligned to the baseline grid. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
.heading-1 {
  margin-bottom: $base-line-height;
}

.recipe-button {
  // ... other styles
  height: $base-line-height * 2;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Relative Vertical Rhythm (or Breaking the Rules)</h2>
<p>The above system for using line height and aligning content to a consistent baseline grid are simply guidelines, not rules. With this said, sometimes a design might deviate from a baseline grid, especially if it&#8217;s not text-heavy or if tighter vertical spacing is desired.</p>
<p>When this is the case, vertical rhythm can still be assumed with <em>relative vertical spacing</em>, as long as a consistent value (or proportional pair of values) is used, such as <code>1rem</code> or <code>0.5rem, 1rem</code>. This can make it easier to rapidly scaffold and code a design.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
// Example using 1rem or 0.5rem consistently,
// regardless of base line height
.field, .heading-1, .paragraph /* etc. */ {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.field &gt; .label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>Using the original mockup, let&#8217;s put this to code and see how aligning to a vertical baseline grid produces an aesthetic design on the web, without using magic numbers. We&#8217;ll use a <code>@mixin</code> to help us out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">
@mixin type-setting($level: 0) {
  font-size: type-scale($level);
  line-height: line-height($level);
}

// The main heading
.heading-1 { @include type-setting(2); }

// The smaller top heading
.heading-2 { @include type-setting(-1); }

.paragraph { @include type-setting(0); }

.recipe-value { @include type-setting(1); }

.recipe-text { @include type-setting(-1); }

.recipe-button { @include type-setting(-1); }
</code></pre>
<p>With the rest of the styling added, here is our end-result (hover over the recipe card to see the baseline grid):</p>

<p>Investing a little bit of time into using a baseline grid and calculating font sizes based on a modular scale allows you to create aesthetic, consistent styles without the need for magic numbers or pixel-pushing. Vertical rhythm can also be used for more than just text elements &#8212; it can be used to calculate vertical margins and/or padding between elements, as well as adjusting the height of static elements so that they align to the baseline grid.</p>
<p>As always, the guidelines above are merely suggestions. There&#8217;s more than one way to organize your type settings (see the SCSS in the Codepen example) and you might define your Sass functions and mixins differently, but the underlying principles are the same: <em>organize important style values into maps, lists, and/or variables</em> and stay consistent with these values. That way, they become easier to use and manipulate throughout your Sass projects.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:48:"Aesthetic Sass 3: Typography and Vertical
