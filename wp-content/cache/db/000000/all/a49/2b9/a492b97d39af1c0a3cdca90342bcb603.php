<div class="info" style="text-align: left;">So I sort of fell into UX Design when I discovered a few years ago that what I was most passionate about was defining products and creating good, intuitive experiences that not only delighted users, but met product/business goals. My answer probably goes a bit more in depth than just learning the basics of UX design.

Here's a rough path to how I "picked up" UX design:</div>
<ol>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Read a few UX books such as Designing for the Digital Age, Don't Make Me Think, and The Inmates are Running the AsylumÂ  (this is a good way to learn just the very basics of UX. Don't Make Me Think is pretty much the "bible" of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">My daily/weekly readings would consist of UX blogs such as Boxes and Arrows (also a good way of picking up the basic understandings of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">I took a class on User Experience just to get the fundamentals/basics down - this class actually didn't teach me a lot since much of it was stuff I was doing already.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Probably the most powerful method of practicing/picking up UX design skills is just by doing UX design. For fun, I would look at the websites of products/services I used then redesign them in Illustrator or Photoshop. My goal was to improve the experience while also lightly guiding the user towards actions that met whatever the goal was.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Do user tests and user studies to see how people interact with products, and also to understand that what may be obvious to you or a product team isn't necessarily obvious to the end user. This is a good way to get a sense of how people interact with products - and also a good way to constantly remind yourself that you are not the target demographic. Real users think differently than those creating the products.Â Before design and, more specifically, user experience, was getting as much attention as it is now, I was doing user studies and user testing. At the time, I didn't know that what I was doing was user experience research until I attended an event where Karlyn Neel (Quora is being really slow right now and won't let me tag anything or anyone, sorry), lead designer of eBay's mobile app, spoke. When she spoke about design and creating for the user, I had an epiphany of sorts, in that, what I wanted to do was define products and delight users. So every step I'd taken after that was to become a design product manager - which brings me to</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue UX, then just start doing it even if you're in a position that's not technically in product or design. Example: I was working in the marketing department for a mid-stage startup where I owned the website. I treated the marketing site (the product was an API) like a product. I wasn't super passionate about Marketing beyond how I could get more visitors on our site to convert into leads, so I left and joined a gaming company as a design product manager. Now I'm a design product manager, or, product designer as we are more commonly known as.</li>
</ol>
Basically, what was once a hobby is now something I get paid for - except, it doesn't feel like just a job because I genuinely love doing what I'm doing. So if you're genuinely passionate about user experience and design, just start doing it and you'll learn the basics, and then some, as you go along.
