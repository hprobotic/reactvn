These six quick tips will result in better, more usable services.

<h2>Use HTTP Verbs to Make Your Requests Mean Something</h2>

API consumers are capable of sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE verbs, which greatly enhance the clarity of a given request.

Generally, the four primary HTTP verbs are used as follows:

<dl>
    <dt>GET</dt>
    <dd>Read a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources.</dd>
    <dt>PUT</dt>
    <dd>Update a specific resource (by an identifier) or a collection of resources. Can also be used to create a specific resource if the resource identifier is know before-hand.</dd>
    <dt>DELETE</dt>
    <dd>Remove/delete a specific resource by an identifier.</dd>
    <dt>POST</dt>
    <dd>Create a new resource. Also a catch-all verb for operations that don't fit into the other categories.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Note</h3>

GET requests must not change any underlying resource data. Measurements and tracking which update data may still occur, but the resource data identified by the URI should not change.

<h2>Provide Sensible Resource Names</h2>

Producing a great API is 80% art and 20% science. Creating a URL hierarchy representing sensible resources is the art part. Having sensible resource names (which are just URL paths, such as /customers/12345/orders) improves the clarity of what a given request does.

Appropriate resource names provide context for a service request, increasing understandability of the API. Resources are viewed hierarchically via their URI names, offering consumers a friendly, easily-understood hierarchy of resources to leverage in their applications.

Here are some quick-hit rules for URL path (resource name) design:

<ul>
    <li>Use identifiers in your URLs instead of in the query-string. Using URL query-string parameters is fantastic for filtering, but not for resource names.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Good:</strong> /users/12345</li>
    <li><strong>Poor:</strong> /api?type=user&amp;id=23</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Leverage the hierarchical nature of the URL to imply structure.</li>
    <li>Design for your clients, not for your data.</li>
    <li>Resource names should be nouns. Avoid verbs as resource names, to improve clarity. Use the HTTP methods to specify the verb portion of the request.</li>
    <li>Use plurals in URL segments to keep your API URIs consistent across all HTTP methods, using the collection metaphor.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> /customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1</li>
    <li><strong>Not:</strong> /customer/33245/order/8769/lineitem/1</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Avoid using collection verbiage in URLs. For example 'customer_list' as a resource. Use pluralization to indicate the collection metaphor (e.g. customers vs. customer_list).</li>
    <li>Use lower-case in URL segments, separating words with underscores ('_') or hyphens ('-'). Some servers ignore case so it's best to be clear.</li>
    <li>Keep URLs as short as possible, with as few segments as makes sense.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use HTTP Response Codes to Indicate Status</h2>

Response status codes are part of the HTTP specification. There are quite a number of them to address the most common situations. In the spirit of having our RESTful services embrace the HTTP specification, our Web APIs should return relevant HTTP status codes. For example, when a resource is successfully created (e.g. from a POST request), the API should return HTTP status code 201. A list of valid <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html">HTTP status codes</a> is available <a href="http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html">here</a> which lists detailed descriptions of each.

Suggested usages for the "Top 10" HTTP Response Status Codes are as follows:

<dl>
    <dt>200 OK</dt>
    <dd>General success status code. This is the most common code. Used to indicate success.</dd>
    <dt>201 CREATED</dt>
    <dd>Successful creation occurred (via either POST or PUT). Set the Location header to contain a link to the newly-created resource (on POST). Response body content may or may not be present.</dd>
    <dt>204 NO CONTENT</dt>
    <dd>Indicates success but nothing is in the response body, often used for DELETE and PUT operations.</dd>
    <dt>400 BAD REQUEST</dt>
    <dd>General error for when fulfilling the request would cause an invalid state. Domain validation errors, missing data, etc. are some examples.</dd>
    <dt>401 UNAUTHORIZED</dt>
    <dd>Error code response for missing or invalid authentication token.</dd>
    <dt>403 FORBIDDEN</dt>
    <dd>Error code for when the user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason (e.g. time constraints, etc.).</dd>
    <dt>404 NOT FOUND</dt>
    <dd>Used when the requested resource is not found, whether it doesn't exist or if there was a 401 or 403 that, for security reasons, the service wants to mask.</dd>
    <dt>405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED</dt>
    <dd>Used to indicate that the requested URL exists, but the requested HTTP method is not applicable. For example, POST <em>/users/12345</em> where the API doesn't support creation of resources this way (with a provided ID). The Allow HTTP header must be set when returning a 405 to indicate the HTTP methods that are supported. In the previous case, the header would look like "Allow: GET, PUT, DELETE"</dd>
    <dt>409 CONFLICT</dt>
    <dd>Whenever a resource conflict would be caused by fulfilling the request. Duplicate entries, such as trying to create two customers with the same information, and deleting root objects when cascade-delete is not supported are a couple of examples.</dd>
    <dt>500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR</dt>
    <dd>Never return this intentionally. The general catch-all error when the server-side throws an exception. Use this only for errors that the consumer cannot address from their end.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Offer Both JSON and XML</h2>

Favor JSON support unless you're in a highly-standardized and regulated industry that requires XML, schema validation and namespaces, and offer both JSON and XML unless the costs are staggering. Ideally, let consumers switch between formats using the HTTP Accept header, or by just changing an extension from .xml to .json on the URL.

Be aware that as soon as we start talking about XML support, we start talking about schemas for validation, namespaces, etc. Unless required by your industry, avoid supporting all that complexity initially, if ever. JSON is designed to be simple, terse and functional. Make your XML look like that if you can.

In other words, make the XML that is returned more JSON-like ‚Äî simple and easy to read, without the schema and namespace details present, just data and links. If it ends up being more complex than this, the cost of XML will be staggering. In my experience no one has used XML responses anyway for the last several years, it's just too expensive to consume.

Note that <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> offers schema-style validation capabilities, if you need that sort of thing.

<h2>Create Fine-Grained Resources</h2>

When starting out, it's best to create APIs that mimic the underlying application domain or database architecture of your system. Eventually, you'll want aggregate services that utilize multiple underlying resources to reduce chattiness. However, it's much easier to create larger resources later from individual resources than it is to create fine-grained or individual resources from larger aggregates. Make it easy on yourself and start with small, easily defined resources, providing CRUD functionality on those. You can create those use-case-oriented, chattiness-reducing resources later.

<h2>Consider Connectedness</h2>

One of the principles of REST is connectedness‚Äîvia hypermedia links (search HATEOAS). While services are still useful without them, APIs become more self-descriptive and discoverable when links are returned in the response. At the very least, a 'self' link reference informs clients how the data was or can be retrieved. Additionally, utilize the HTTP Location header to contain a link on resource creation via POST (or PUT). For collections returned in a response that support pagination, 'first', 'last', 'next' and 'prev' links at a minimum are very helpful.

Regarding linking formats, there are many. The HTTP Web Linking Specification (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5988">RFC5988</a>) explains a link as follows:

<blockquote>a link is a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc3987">RFC3987</a>], and is comprised of:
<ul>
    <li>A context IRI,</li>
    <li>a link relation type</li>
    <li>a target IRI, and</li>
    <li>optionally, target attributes.</li>
</ul>
A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target attributes}."</blockquote>

At the very least, place links in the HTTP Link header as recommended in the specification, or embrace a JSON representation of this HTTP link style (such as Atom-style links, see: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4287#section-4.2.7">RFC4287</a>) in your JSON representations. Later, you can layer in more complex linking styles such as <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL+JSON</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren">Siren</a>, <a href="http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/">Collection+JSON</a>, and/or <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>, etc. as your REST APIs become more mature.

The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our ‚Äúuniform interface‚Äù constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used more often than others.

Below is a more-detailed discussion of the main HTTP methods.
<h3>POST</h3>
The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.

On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.

POST is neither safe nor idempotent. It is therefore recommended for non-idempotent resource requests. Making two identical POST requests will most-likely result in two resources containing the same information.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em></li>
    <li><em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>GET</h3>
The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET (along with HEAD) requests are used only to read data and not change it. Therefore, when used this way, they are considered safe. That is, they can be called without risk of data modification or corruption‚Äîcalling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times, or none at all. Additionally, GET (and HEAD) is idempotent, which means that making multiple identical requests ends up having the same result as a single request.

Do not expose unsafe operations via GET‚Äîit should never modify any resources on the server.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
    <li><em>GET http://www.example.com/buckets/sample</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PUT</h3>
PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.

However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.

Alternatively, use POST to create new resources and provide the client-defined ID in the body representation‚Äîpresumably to a URI that doesn't include the ID of the resource (see POST below).

On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. A body in the response is optional‚Äîproviding one consumes more bandwidth. It is not necessary to return a link via a Location header in the creation case since the client already set the resource ID.

PUT is not a safe operation, in that it modifies (or creates) state on the server, but it is idempotent. In other words, if you create or update a resource using PUT and then make that same call again, the resource is still there and still has the same state as it did with the first call.

If, for instance, calling PUT on a resource increments a counter within the resource, the call is no longer idempotent. Sometimes that happens and it may be enough to document that the call is not idempotent. However, it's recommended to keep PUT requests idempotent. It is strongly recommended to use POST for non-idempotent requests.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
    <li><em>PUT http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>PATCH</h3>
</div>
PATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.

This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.

PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent. However, a PATCH request can be issued in such a way as to be idempotent, which also helps prevent bad outcomes from collisions between two PATCH requests on the same resource in a similar time frame. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be more dangerous than PUT collisions because some patch formats need to operate from a known base-point or else they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch application should use a conditional request such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource. For example, the client can use a strong ETag in an If-Match header on the PATCH request.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders/98765</em></li>
    <li><em>PATCH http://www.example.com/buckets/secret_stuff</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>DELETE</h3>
DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.

On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body, perhaps the representation of the deleted item (often demands too much bandwidth), or a wrapped response (see Return Values below). Either that or return HTTP status 204 (NO CONTENT) with no response body. In other words, a 204 status with no body, or the JSEND-style response and HTTP status 200 are the recommended responses.

HTTP-spec-wise, DELETE operations are idempotent. If you DELETE a resource, it's removed. Repeatedly calling DELETE on that resource ends up the same: the resource is gone. If calling DELETE say, decrements a counter (within the resource), the DELETE call is no longer idempotent. As mentioned previously, usage statistics and measurements may be updated while still considering the service idempotent as long as no resource data is changed. Using POST for non-idempotent resource requests is recommended.

There is a caveat about DELETE idempotence, however. Calling DELETE on a resource a second time will often return a 404 (NOT FOUND) since it was already removed and therefore is no longer findable. This, by some opinions, makes DELETE operations no longer idempotent, however, the end-state of the resource is the same. Returning a 404 is acceptable and communicates accurately the status of the call.

<strong>Examples:</strong>
<ul>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345</em></li>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/orders</em></li>
    <li><em>DELETE http://www.example.com/bucket/sample</em></li>

The HTTP verbs comprise a major portion of our ‚Äúuniform interface‚Äù constraint and provide us the action counterpart to the noun-based resource. The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other verbs, too, but are utilized less frequently. Of those less-frequent methods, OPTIONS and HEAD are used more often than others.

When resources are named well, an API is intuitive and easy to use. Done poorly, that same API can feel klutzy and be difficult to use and understand. Below are a few tips to get you going when creating the resource URIs for your new API.

Essentially, a RESTful API ends up being simply a collection of URIs, HTTP calls to those URIs and some JSON and/or XML representations of resources, many of which will contain relational links. The RESTful principal of addressability is covered by the URIs. Each resource has its own address or URI‚Äîevery interesting piece of information the server can provide is exposed as a resource. The constraint of uniform interface is partially addressed by the combination of URIs and HTTP verbs, and using them in line with the standards and conventions.

In deciding what resources are within your system, name them as nouns as opposed to verbs or actions. In other words, a RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing instead of referring to an action. Nouns have properties as verbs do not, just another distinguishing factor.

Some example resources are:

<ul>
    <li>Users of the system.</li>
    <li>Courses in which a student is enrolled.</li>
    <li>A user's timeline of posts.</li>
    <li>The users that follow another user.</li>
    <li>An article about horseback riding.</li>
</ul>

Each resource in a service suite will have at least one URI identifying it. And it's best when that URI makes sense and adequately describes the resource. URIs should follow a predictable, hierarchical structure to enhance understandability and, therefore, usability: predictable in the sense that they're consistent, hierarchical in the sense that data has structure‚Äîrelationships. This is not a REST rule or constraint, but it enhances the API.

RESTful APIs are written for consumers. The name and structure of URIs should convey meaning to those consumers. It's often difficult to know what the data boundaries should be, but with understanding of your data, you most-likely are equipped to take a stab and what makes sense to return as a representation to your clients. Design for your clients, not for your data.

Let's say we're describing an order system with customers, orders, line items, products, etc. Consider the URIs involved in describing the resources in this service suite:

<h3>Resource URI Examples</h3>

To insert (create) a new customer in the system, we might use:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

To read a customer with Customer ID# 33245:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em> The same URI would be used for PUT and DELETE, to update and delete, respectively.

Here are proposed URIs for products:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/products</em> for creating a new product.

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/products/66432</em>
for reading, updating, deleting product 66432, respectively.

Now, here is where it gets fun... What about creating a new order for a customer? One option might be: POST http://www.example.com/orders And that could work to create an order, but it's arguably outside the context of a customer.

Because we want to create an order for a customer (note the relationship), this URI perhaps is not as intuitive as it could be. It could be argued that the following URI would offer better clarity: <em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em> Now we know we're creating an order for customer ID# 33245.

Now what would the following return?
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em>
Probably a list of orders that customer #33245 has created or owns. Note: we may choose to not support DELETE or PUT for that url since it's operating on a collection.

Now, to continue the hierarchical concept, what about the following URI?
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems</em>
That might add a line item to order #8769 (which is for customer #33245). Right! GET for that URI might return all the line items for that order. However, if line items don't make sense only in customer context or also make sense outside the context of a customer, we would offer a POST www.example.com/orders/8769/lineitems URI.

Along those lines, because there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, we might also offer a GET http://www.example.com/orders/8769 URI that supports retrieving an order by number without having to know the customer number.

To go one layer deeper in the hierarchy:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1</em>
Might return only the first line item in that same order.

By now you can see how the hierarchy concept works. There aren't any hard and fast rules, only make sure the imposed structure makes sense to consumers of your services. As with everything in the craft of Software Development, naming is critical to success.

Look at some widely used APIs to get the hang of this and leverage the intuition of your teammates to refine your API resource URIs. Some example APIs are:

<ul>
    <li>Twitter: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api</li>
    <li>Facebook: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/</li>
    <li>LinkedIn: https://developer.linkedin.com/apis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resource Naming Anti-Patterns</h3>

While we've discussed some examples of appropriate resource names, sometimes it's informative to see some anti-patterns. Below are some examples of poor RESTful resource URIs seen in the "wild." These are examples of what not to do!

First up, often services use a single URI to specify the service interface, using query-string parameters to specify the requested operation and/or HTTP verb. For example to update customer with ID 12345, the request for a JSON body might be:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/services?op=update_customer&amp;id=12345&amp;format=json</em>

By now, you're above doing this. Even though the 'services' URL node is a noun, this URL is not self- descriptive as the URI hierarchy is the same for all requests. Plus, it uses GET as the HTTP verb even though we're performing an update. This is counter-intuitive and is painful (even dangerous) to use as a client.

Here's another example following the same operation of updating a customer:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/update_customer/12345</em>

And its evil twin:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

You'll see this one a lot as you visit other developer's service suites. Note that the developer is attempting to create RESTful resource names and has made some progress. But you're better than this ‚Äîable to identify the verb phrase in the URL. Notice that we don't need to use the 'update' verb phrase in the URL because we can rely on the HTTP verb to inform that operation. Just to clarify, the following resource URL is redundant:

<em>PUT http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

With both PUT and 'update' in the request, we're offering to confuse our service consumers! Is 'update' the resource? So, we've spent some time beating the horse at this point. I'm certain you understand...

<h3>Pluralization</h3>

Let's talk about the debate between the pluralizers and the "singularizers"... Haven't heard of that debate? It does exist. Essentially, it boils down to this question...

Should URI nodes in your hierarchy be named using singular or plural nouns? For example, should your URI for retrieving a representation of a customer resource look like this:

<em>GET http://www.example.com/customer/33245</em> or: <em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em>

There are good arguments on both sides, but the commonly-accepted practice is to always use plurals in node names to keep your API URIs consistent across all HTTP methods. The reasoning is based on the concept that customers are a collection within the service suite and the ID (e.g. 33245) refers to one of those customers in the collection.

Using this rule, an example multi-node URI using pluralization would look like (emphasis added):

<em>GET http://www.example.com/<strong>customers</strong>/33245/<strong>orders</strong>/8769/<strong>lineitems</strong>/1</em>

with 'customers', 'orders', and 'lineitems' URI nodes all being their plural forms.

This implies that you only really need two base URLs for each root resource. One for creation of the resource within a collection and the second for reading, updating and deleting the resource by its identifier. For example the creation case, using customers as the example, is handled by the following URL:

<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

And the read, update and delete cases are handled by the following:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/{id}</em>

As mentioned earlier, there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, but as a minimum full CRUD capabilities are aptly handled with two simple URIs.

You ask if there is a case where pluralization doesn't make sense. Well, yes, in fact there is. When there isn't a collection concept in play. In other words, it's acceptable to use a singularized resource name when there can only be one of the resource‚Äîit's a singleton resource. For example, if there was a single, overarching configuration resource, you might use a singularized noun to represent that:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/configuration</em>

Note the lack of a configuration ID and usage of POST verb. And say that there was only one configuration per customer, then the URL might be:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/configuration</em>

Again, no ID for the configuration and no POST verb usage. Although, I'm sure that in both of these cases POST usage might be argued to be valid. Well...

This is not a REST rule or constraint, but it enhances the API.

RESTful APIs are written for consumers. The name and structure of URIs should convey meaning to those consumers. It's often difficult to know what the data boundaries should be, but with understanding of your data, you most-likely are equipped to take a stab and what makes sense to return as a representation to your clients. Design for your clients, not for your data.

Let's say we're describing an order system with customers, orders, line items, products, etc. Consider the URIs involved in describing the resources in this service suite:
<h3>Resource URI Examples</h3>
To insert (create) a new customer in the system, we might use:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

To read a customer with Customer ID# 33245:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em> The same URI would be used for PUT and DELETE, to update and delete, respectively.

Here are proposed URIs for products:
<em>POST http://www.example.com/products</em> for creating a new product.

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/products/66432</em>
for reading, updating, deleting product 66432, respectively.

Now, here is where it gets fun... What about creating a new order for a customer? One option might be: POST http://www.example.com/orders And that could work to create an order, but it's arguably outside the context of a customer.

Because we want to create an order for a customer (note the relationship), this URI perhaps is not as intuitive as it could be. It could be argued that the following URI would offer better clarity: <em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em> Now we know we're creating an order for customer ID# 33245.

Now what would the following return?
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders</em>
Probably a list of orders that customer #33245 has created or owns. Note: we may choose to not support DELETE or PUT for that url since it's operating on a collection.

Now, to continue the hierarchical concept, what about the following URI?
<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems</em>
That might add a line item to order #8769 (which is for customer #33245). Right! GET for that URI might return all the line items for that order. However, if line items don't make sense only in customer context or also make sense outside the context of a customer, we would offer a POST www.example.com/orders/8769/lineitems URI.

Along those lines, because there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, we might also offer a GET http://www.example.com/orders/8769 URI that supports retrieving an order by number without having to know the customer number.

To go one layer deeper in the hierarchy:
<em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245/orders/8769/lineitems/1</em>
Might return only the first line item in that same order.

By now you can see how the hierarchy concept works. There aren't any hard and fast rules, only make sure the imposed structure makes sense to consumers of your services. As with everything in the craft of Software Development, naming is critical to success.

Look at some widely used APIs to get the hang of this and leverage the intuition of your teammates to refine your API resource URIs. Some example APIs are:
<ul>
 	<li>Twitter: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api</li>
 	<li>Facebook: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/</li>
 	<li>LinkedIn: https://developer.linkedin.com/apis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resource Naming Anti-Patterns</h3>
While we've discussed some examples of appropriate resource names, sometimes it's informative to see some anti-patterns. Below are some examples of poor RESTful resource URIs seen in the "wild." These are examples of what not to do!

First up, often services use a single URI to specify the service interface, using query-string parameters to specify the requested operation and/or HTTP verb. For example to update customer with ID 12345, the request for a JSON body might be:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/services?op=update_customer&amp;id=12345&amp;format=json</em>

By now, you're above doing this. Even though the 'services' URL node is a noun, this URL is not self- descriptive as the URI hierarchy is the same for all requests. Plus, it uses GET as the HTTP verb even though we're performing an update. This is counter-intuitive and is painful (even dangerous) to use as a client.

Here's another example following the same operation of updating a customer:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/update_customer/12345</em>

And its evil twin:

<em>GET http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

You'll see this one a lot as you visit other developer's service suites. Note that the developer is attempting to create RESTful resource names and has made some progress. But you're better than this ‚Äîable to identify the verb phrase in the URL. Notice that we don't need to use the 'update' verb phrase in the URL because we can rely on the HTTP verb to inform that operation. Just to clarify, the following resource URL is redundant:

<em>PUT http://api.example.com/customers/12345/update</em>

With both PUT and 'update' in the request, we're offering to confuse our service consumers! Is 'update' the resource? So, we've spent some time beating the horse at this point. I'm certain you understand...
<h3>Pluralization</h3>
Let's talk about the debate between the pluralizers and the "singularizers"... Haven't heard of that debate? It does exist. Essentially, it boils down to this question...

Should URI nodes in your hierarchy be named using singular or plural nouns? For example, should your URI for retrieving a representation of a customer resource look like this:

<em>GET http://www.example.com/customer/33245</em> or: <em>GET http://www.example.com/customers/33245</em>

There are good arguments on both sides, but the commonly-accepted practice is to always use plurals in node names to keep your API URIs consistent across all HTTP methods. The reasoning is based on the concept that customers are a collection within the service suite and the ID (e.g. 33245) refers to one of those customers in the collection.

Using this rule, an example multi-node URI using pluralization would look like (emphasis added):

<em>GET http://www.example.com/<strong>customers</strong>/33245/<strong>orders</strong>/8769/<strong>lineitems</strong>/1</em>

with 'customers', 'orders', and 'lineitems' URI nodes all being their plural forms.

This implies that you only really need two base URLs for each root resource. One for creation of the resource within a collection and the second for reading, updating and deleting the resource by its identifier. For example the creation case, using customers as the example, is handled by the following URL:

<em>POST http://www.example.com/customers</em>

And the read, update and delete cases are handled by the following:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/{id}</em>

As mentioned earlier, there may be multiple URIs for a given resource, but as a minimum full CRUD capabilities are aptly handled with two simple URIs.

You ask if there is a case where pluralization doesn't make sense. Well, yes, in fact there is. When there isn't a collection concept in play. In other words, it's acceptable to use a singularized resource name when there can only be one of the resource‚Äîit's a singleton resource. For example, if there was a single, overarching configuration resource, you might use a singularized noun to represent that:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/configuration</em>

Note the lack of a configuration ID and usage of POST verb. And say that there was only one configuration per customer, then the URL might be:

<em>GET|PUT|DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345/configuration</em>

Again, no ID for the configuration and no POST verb usage. Although, I'm sure that in both of these cases POST usage might be argued to be valid. Well...

This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).

The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.

<div id="processing" class="collapse">

The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.

Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard.[2] The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.

The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.

The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
<blockquote>Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303.</blockquote>

<div id="not_modified" class="collapse">

If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

The response MUST include the following header fields:
<ul>
    <li>Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1</li>
</ul>
If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.
<ul>
    <li>ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request</li>
    <li>Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant</li>
</ul>
If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.

If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.

Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare.

The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection MAY be altered on occasion, the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cacheable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field.

The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status. Therefore, the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat the original request on the new URI.

If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests can still use the original URI. In contrast to 302, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request.

<div id="net_authn_required" class="collapse">

The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.

The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).

Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.

The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.

Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by "captive portals" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure. It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.

A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so ("unknown clients") using their MAC addresses.

Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the "login server") dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.

In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL. This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.

However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.

Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.

This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line. There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.

A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100 (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be ignored by a user agent.

Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a proxy adds a "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request, then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).)

The client SHOULD continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or, if the request has already been completed, ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed. See section 8.2.3 for detailed discussion of the use and handling of this status code.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).

The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade message header field (section 14.42), for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which terminates the 101 response.

The protocol SHOULD be switched only when it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older versions, and switching to a real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.

<div id="processing" class="collapse">

The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.

Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process, especially methods that support the Depth header. In such cases the client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response. To prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to indicate to the client that the server is still processing the method.
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content- Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection.

<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed to change the method on the redirected request. However, most existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303 response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which kind of reaction is expected of the client.</blockquote>
<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard.[2] The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.

The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second (redirected) request might be cacheable.

The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
<blockquote>Note: Many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 303 status. When interoperability with such clients is a concern, the 302 status code may be used instead, since most user agents react to a 302 response as described here for 303.</blockquote>

If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

The response MUST include the following header fields:
<ul>
 	<li>Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1</li>
</ul>
If a clockless origin server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any response received without one (as already specified by [RFC 2068], section 14.19), caches will operate correctly.
<ul>
 	<li>ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request</li>
 	<li>Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant</li>
</ul>
If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3), the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional.

If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response.

Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare.

The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s) , since many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status.

For example, this error condition may occur if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but semantically erroneous, XML instructions.

For example, if a command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).

Reliable, interoperable negotiation of Upgrade features requires an unambiguous failure signal. The 426 Upgrade Required status code allows a server to definitively state the precise protocol extensions a given resource must be served with.

<div id="precondition_required" class="collapse">

The 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the request to be conditional.

Its typical use is to avoid the "lost update" problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict. By requiring requests to be conditional, the server can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.

Responses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the request successfully.

The 428 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its use to prevent "lost update" conflicts.

The 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").

The response representations SHOULD include details explaining the condition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before making a new request.

When a server is under attack or just receiving a very large number of requests from a single party, responding to each with a 429 status code will consume resources.

Therefore, servers are not required to use the 429 status code; when limiting resource usage, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take other steps.

The 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large. The request MAY be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.

It can be used both when the set of request header fields in total are too large, and when a single header field is at fault. In the latter case, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field was too large.

Servers are not required to use the 431 status code; when under attack, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take other steps.

<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#net_authn_required">511 Network Authentication Required</a>
<div id="net_authn_required" class="collapse">

The 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.

The response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that allows the user to submit credentials (e.g. with a HTML form).

Note that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the login interface itself, because browsers would show the login interface as being associated with the originally requested URL, which may cause confusion.

The 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is intended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a means of controlling access to the network.

Responses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.

The 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by "captive portals" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is expecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not the intervening network infrastructure. It is not intended to encouraged deployment of captive portals, only to limit the damage caused by them.

A network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance of terms or other user interaction before granting access usually does so by identifing clients who have not done so ("unknown clients") using their MAC addresses.

Unknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP port 80, which is sent to a HTTP server (the "login server") dedicated to "logging in" unknown clients, and of course traffic to the login server itself.

In common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come from the origin server indicated in the request's URL. This presents many security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be inserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be observing cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the user agent, and so on.

However, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other words, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces the same issues.

Also, note that captive portals using this status code on an SSL or TLS connection (commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.

<b>Study and Learn From Other People's Code</b>

First, in all my years of software development (30+ years), the single most important learning tool to me in all the languages I've learned has been to study and learn from other people's code.

Ideally, you want to be exposed to well written pieces of code that illustrate good design patterns and tools and techniques that you have not yet seen before.¬† But, you can actually learn from pretty much any code, even poorly written code (where you're more likely to learn things NOT to do).

In the Javascript world, pick up any third party library that seems useful and interesting to you such as jQuery, Angular, Underscore, Backbone, Modernizr, Async, etc...¬† Write some code using it (the non-minimized version).¬† Then, step through some of it's major functions in the debugger and see how to code works and is written.¬† Within seconds, you will likely see design patterns and techniques you aren't normally accustomed to. Understand those.¬†¬† Ask yourself why they are doing it that way and what advantages is it giving them.

Now, build an extension to that module.¬† Understand how the extension mechanism works and is architected.

Load a copy of the library into your code editor and just page down through it.¬† Look for new top level patterns that you aren't accustomed to. When you see one, stop and study it and understand what it's doing and why.

<b>Study and Learn From Other People's Code</b>

First, in all my years of software development (30+ years), the single most important learning tool to me in all the languages I've learned has been to study and learn from other people's code.

Ideally, you want to be exposed to well written pieces of code that illustrate good design patterns and tools and techniques that you have not yet seen before.¬† But, you can actually learn from pretty much any code, even poorly written code (where you're more likely to learn things NOT to do).

In the Javascript world, pick up any third party library that seems useful and interesting to you such as jQuery, Angular, Underscore, Backbone, Modernizr, Async, etc...¬† Write some code using it (the non-minimized version).¬† Then, step through some of it's major functions in the debugger and see how to code works and is written.¬† Within seconds, you will likely see design patterns and techniques you aren't normally accustomed to. Understand those.¬†¬† Ask yourself why they are doing it that way and what advantages is it giving them.

Now, build an extension to that module.¬† Understand how the extension mechanism works and is architected.

Load a copy of the library into your code editor and just page down through it.¬† Look for new top level patterns that you aren't accustomed to. When you see one, stop and study it and understand what it's doing and why.

HTTP2 is not available by default, to get it you need to install <a href="https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2">hyper-h2</a> (just run<code>pip install twisted[h2]</code>). This is really big and exciting news for whole Python ecosystem so it‚Äôs worth seeing how it works and how difficult or easy it is to set up.

In this post I‚Äôm going to build some simple Twisted website serving content over HTTP 2 and then create a client connecting to this sample site. Will there be any big difference in performance between HTTP 2 and HTTP 1.1? Will my demo site work quicker in HTTP2?

<h2 id="hello-http2">Hello HTTP2</h2>

Let‚Äôs start with saying ‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù in HTTP 2 from Python Twisted.

<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/using-twistedweb.html">Twisted web server</a> already supports Python 3 so you can use 3 no problem. For this blog post I‚Äôm going to use Python 3.4.3. I‚Äôm assuming you have Twisted 16.3.0 with all HTTP2 dependencies installed. There is some minor bug in parsing optional dependencies in Python 3, so if you‚Äôre using 3 you may need to install ‚Äúh2‚Äù and ‚Äúpriority‚Äù packages from pip manually instead of running <code>pip install twisted[h2]</code>.

Our website will serve content over HTTPS. While HTTP2 protocol itself does not require TLS, most client implementations (especially mainstream browsers) do require HTTPS. This means we need to start building our website with getting self signed certificates for local development. To generate self signed certificate you need to run following command:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># generate private key</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl genrsa &gt; privkey.pem
<span class="c"># generate certificate that will be stored in cert.pem file</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes</code></pre>

</figure>After running above command you‚Äôll need to fill out some details about you. You can ignore most of it or set some fake values, but keep in mind that some clients will refuse to connect if common name is not set to host name. Remember to put ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù if openssl asks you about ‚Äúcommon name‚Äù.

Now that we have our ssl certificates let‚Äôs build simple ‚Äúhello world‚Äù Twisted resource serving HTTP2 over HTTPS.

Our resource will be really simplest possible and it will look like this:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Resource</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">isLeaf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">render_GET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s">"hello world (in HTTP2)"</span></code></pre>

</figure>Above code creates simple resource that will handle all request to root of website.

We now need to tell Twisted to listen on some specific port and serve our resource there using TLS. To actually launch our site on connection speaking SSL we‚Äôll use <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/endpoints.html">Twisted endpoints</a>. Endpoints are the recommended approach to do SSL in Twisted. In the past you could use Twisted DefaultSSLContextFactory, but this API is going to be deprecated in future releases. Factory misses lots of SSL features, is insecure and it won‚Äôt work properly with HTTP 2.

Here‚Äôs how you properly create instance of https website in Twisted:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># create instance of our web resource Index is instance of twisted.web.Resource</span>
<span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Site</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Index</span><span class="p">())</span>

<span class="c"># specify port and certificate</span>
<span class="n">endpoint_spec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"ssl:port=8080:privateKey=privkey.pem:certKey=cert.pem"</span>

<span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">site</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre>

</figure>Full hello world example will look like this:

</figure>So now we have Twisted server that has some alleged HTTP 2 support, but how do we actually test it? Obviously we need some HTTP2 client. One such client is curl. Unfortunately by default curl does not come with HTTP2 support. To be able to use HTTP2 you need to install optional dependencies and compile from source passing flag telling curl2 to compile with HTTP2 support. This is <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/video/curl-with-http2-support">nicely described here</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tools-for-debugging-testing-and-using-http-2/">also here</a>.

After installing curl you can test your website like this

<figure class="highlight">

</figure>You can see curl reports that it uses HTTP2 on connection level but then actual request part is HTTP 1.1. This is expected. HTTP2 does not change HTTP semantics, all HTTP verbs, headers etc is valid in HTTP2. Majority of HTTP2 happens on TCP connection level.

In your server logs you should see following messages:

</figure>This line <code>"-" - - [27/Jul/2016:11:20:18 +0000] "GET / HTTP/2" 200 22 "-" "curl/7.49.1"</code> tells you that server used HTTP 2 when responding to curl request.

<h2 id="hello-world-in-chrome">Hello world in Chrome</h2>

Why did I use curl and not just plain browser such as Chrome? The problem is that Chrome is super restrictive in HTTP 2 support. Chrome requires all connections to use ALPN protocol negotiation. This is<a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/supporting-http2-google-chrome-users/">discussed in detail here</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/day-google-chrome-disables-http2-nearly-everyone-may-31st-2016/">here</a>. To support ALPN your system has to have OpenSSL version above 1.0.2. At the moment of writing vast majority of Linux systems dont have OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed. Only Ubuntu 16.04 comes with OpenSSL 1.0.2. If you‚Äôre on Linux Upgrading your OpenSSL system wide is not a trivial task. I‚Äôm not sure about Mac OS or Widows or other OS-es. I recommend you check your openssl version yourself, if it‚Äôs above 1.0.2 you‚Äôre good to go testing in Chrome. Otherwise I created simple <a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile here</a> using Ubuntu 16.04 and installing all dependencies, there‚Äôs also associated<a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Makefile">makefile here</a> that tells you how to build and run docker image.

Once you have all dependencies, you also need to make Chrome accept your fake self signed certificate. Steps how to accomplish this are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1757620">described here</a>

As you see making HTTP2 work in Chrome is not a trivial task. Once you‚Äôre ready you can test HTTP2 support by opening dev tools. Enabling ‚Äòprotocol‚Äô column will allow you to see version of protocol used in connection, e.g. your dev tools should show something like this:

<a href="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png"><img src="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png" /></a>

<h2 id="benchmark-http2-vs-http11">Benchmark HTTP2 vs HTTP1.1</h2>

Now that we know how to serve working (and secure) HTTP2 website with Twisted we can move to some more interesting things and compare differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2. Does it really matter if site is HTTP2 or HTTP1.1? Is there any real need to bother about HTTP2?

To try out things I‚Äôm going to build super simple online book store HTTP API. My book store will have 3000 science fiction books in store including classics by Ray Bradbury and Frank Herbert. I extracted data from goodreads.com with some trivial Scrapy project. You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/master/books.json">download data from here</a>. My bookstore will have initial page that lists all book ids in JSON. Each book will then have it‚Äôs own page where you can see some page details. Client will randomly first request index list and it will then visit each specific page to see what‚Äôs there. One client will parse HTTP1.1, other one will parse HTTP2. Which one will be quicker?

My API will look like this:

</figure>If you‚Äôd like to launch this server with me you can find <a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2">all materials here</a>

Now let‚Äôs see how HTTP1.1 client will perform when trying to crawl our SF bookstore. The client is going to be plain synchronous script using python-requests. It will first visit initial page with all book ids. After fetching all book ids it will request each book details page and read response. HTTP1.1 client will reuse one TCP connection. It will send ‚Äòconnection: keep-alive‚Äô header and all requests will be send one after another within one TCP connection.

</figure>Running above client on my test server produces following metrics:

<figure class="highlight">

</figure>This means that client needed around 5 seconds to process our sf website.

Now let‚Äôs try HTTP2 client. In essence it will do same thing as HTTP1.1 client, it will connect to initial index page, fetch all books ids and request one book after another. The only difference is that the client will use <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed">HTTP2 multiplexing</a>. This means that instead of sending requests one after another and waiting for responses we‚Äôll send multiple requests at once and then we‚Äôll fetch responses. HTTP 1.1 allows you to reuse TCP connection but the process is:

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>

</figure>from what I understand in HTTP2 the process is more like

<figure class="highlight">

<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">start</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span>

<span class="o">====</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="o">====</span></code></pre>

</figure>In HTTP1.1 if you have one slow response it will block connection. In HTTP2 you can send multiple requests to your server over one connection at the same time and then fetch responses as they arrive from origin.

To use HTTP2 to its full capabilities our client is going to send multiple requests over one connection and then fetch responses. It will split initial list of 3000 books into chunks of 100 urls. For every chunk it will start with sending 100 requests. In next step it will iterate over connection stream ids and fetch responses.

I‚Äôm going to use <a href="https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper">python-hyper</a> as underlying client library. Twisted does not yet support HTTP2 client side, but work on supporting it is in progress.

</figure>To sum up HTTP2 client is faster, but it also works slightly differently. If you were to use HTTP2 in same way as HTTP1.1 (just send one request after another within one connection) performance difference would be small or non-existent. It‚Äôs also worth noting that I didnt go into details of other HTTP2 improvements (such as headers compression or server push). These other benefits of HTTP2 are certainly equally important as multiplexing of messages over one connection. I‚Äôm not sure if you can use server push from Twisted though.

HTTP2 is not available by default, to get it you need to install <a href="https://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2">hyper-h2</a> (just run<code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install twisted[h2]</code>). This is really big and exciting news for whole Python ecosystem so it‚Äôs worth seeing how it works and how difficult or easy it is to set up.

In this post I‚Äôm going to build some simple Twisted website serving content over HTTP 2 and then create a client connecting to this sample site. Will there be any big difference in performance between HTTP 2 and HTTP 1.1? Will my demo site work quicker in HTTP2?
<h2 id="hello-http2">Hello HTTP2</h2>
Let‚Äôs start with saying ‚ÄúHello world!‚Äù in HTTP 2 from Python Twisted.

<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/using-twistedweb.html">Twisted web server</a> already supports Python 3 so you can use 3 no problem. For this blog post I‚Äôm going to use Python 3.4.3. I‚Äôm assuming you have Twisted 16.3.0 with all HTTP2 dependencies installed. There is some minor bug in parsing optional dependencies in Python 3, so if you‚Äôre using 3 you may need to install ‚Äúh2‚Äù and ‚Äúpriority‚Äù packages from pip manually instead of running <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install twisted[h2]</code>.

Our website will serve content over HTTPS. While HTTP2 protocol itself does not require TLS, most client implementations (especially mainstream browsers) do require HTTPS. This means we need to start building our website with getting self signed certificates for local development. To generate self signed certificate you need to run following command:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># generate private key</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl genrsa &gt; privkey.pem
<span class="c"># generate certificate that will be stored in cert.pem file</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes</code></pre>
</figure>After running above command you‚Äôll need to fill out some details about you. You can ignore most of it or set some fake values, but keep in mind that some clients will refuse to connect if common name is not set to host name. Remember to put ‚Äúlocalhost‚Äù if openssl asks you about ‚Äúcommon name‚Äù.

Now that we have our ssl certificates let‚Äôs build simple ‚Äúhello world‚Äù Twisted resource serving HTTP2 over HTTPS.

Our resource will be really simplest possible and it will look like this:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Resource</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">isLeaf</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">render_GET</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="s">"hello world (in HTTP2)"</span></code></pre>
</figure>Above code creates simple resource that will handle all request to root of website.

We now need to tell Twisted to listen on some specific port and serve our resource there using TLS. To actually launch our site on connection speaking SSL we‚Äôll use <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/endpoints.html">Twisted endpoints</a>. Endpoints are the recommended approach to do SSL in Twisted. In the past you could use Twisted DefaultSSLContextFactory, but this API is going to be deprecated in future releases. Factory misses lots of SSL features, is insecure and it won‚Äôt work properly with HTTP 2.

Here‚Äôs how you properly create instance of https website in Twisted:

<figure class="highlight">
<pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c"># create instance of our web resource Index is instance of twisted.web.Resource</span>
<span class="n">site</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Site</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Index</span><span class="p">())</span>

</figure>So now we have Twisted server that has some alleged HTTP 2 support, but how do we actually test it? Obviously we need some HTTP2 client. One such client is curl. Unfortunately by default curl does not come with HTTP2 support. To be able to use HTTP2 you need to install optional dependencies and compile from source passing flag telling curl2 to compile with HTTP2 support. This is <a href="https://serversforhackers.com/video/curl-with-http2-support">nicely described here</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tools-for-debugging-testing-and-using-http-2/">also here</a>.

After installing curl you can test your website like this

</figure>You can see curl reports that it uses HTTP2 on connection level but then actual request part is HTTP 1.1. This is expected. HTTP2 does not change HTTP semantics, all HTTP verbs, headers etc is valid in HTTP2. Majority of HTTP2 happens on TCP connection level.

In your server logs you should see following messages:

<h2 id="hello-world-in-chrome">Hello world in Chrome</h2>
Why did I use curl and not just plain browser such as Chrome? The problem is that Chrome is super restrictive in HTTP 2 support. Chrome requires all connections to use ALPN protocol negotiation. This is<a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/supporting-http2-google-chrome-users/">discussed in detail here</a> and <a href="https://ma.ttias.be/day-google-chrome-disables-http2-nearly-everyone-may-31st-2016/">here</a>. To support ALPN your system has to have OpenSSL version above 1.0.2. At the moment of writing vast majority of Linux systems dont have OpenSSL 1.0.2 installed. Only Ubuntu 16.04 comes with OpenSSL 1.0.2. If you‚Äôre on Linux Upgrading your OpenSSL system wide is not a trivial task. I‚Äôm not sure about Mac OS or Widows or other OS-es. I recommend you check your openssl version yourself, if it‚Äôs above 1.0.2 you‚Äôre good to go testing in Chrome. Otherwise I created simple <a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Dockerfile">Dockerfile here</a> using Ubuntu 16.04 and installing all dependencies, there‚Äôs also associated<a href="https://github.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/blob/master/Makefile">makefile here</a> that tells you how to build and run docker image.

Once you have all dependencies, you also need to make Chrome accept your fake self signed certificate. Steps how to accomplish this are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1757620">described here</a>

As you see making HTTP2 work in Chrome is not a trivial task. Once you‚Äôre ready you can test HTTP2 support by opening dev tools. Enabling ‚Äòprotocol‚Äô column will allow you to see version of protocol used in connection, e.g. your dev tools should show something like this:

<a href="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png"><img src="https://pawelmhm.github.io/assets/h2_screen.png" /></a>
<h2 id="benchmark-http2-vs-http11">Benchmark HTTP2 vs HTTP1.1</h2>
Now that we know how to serve working (and secure) HTTP2 website with Twisted we can move to some more interesting things and compare differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2. Does it really matter if site is HTTP2 or HTTP1.1? Is there any real need to bother about HTTP2?

To try out things I‚Äôm going to build super simple online book store HTTP API. My book store will have 3000 science fiction books in store including classics by Ray Bradbury and Frank Herbert. I extracted data from goodreads.com with some trivial Scrapy project. You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pawelmhm/sf-books-http2/master/books.json">download data from here</a>. My bookstore will have initial page that lists all book ids in JSON. Each book will then have it‚Äôs own page where you can see some page details. Client will randomly first request index list and it will then visit each specific page to see what‚Äôs there. One client will parse HTTP1.1, other one will parse HTTP2. Which one will be quicker?

My API will look like this:

Now let‚Äôs see how HTTP1.1 client will perform when trying to crawl our SF bookstore. The client is going to be plain synchronous script using python-requests. It will first visit initial page with all book ids. After fetching all book ids it will request each book details page and read response. HTTP1.1 client will reuse one TCP connection. It will send ‚Äòconnection: keep-alive‚Äô header and all requests will be send one after another within one TCP connection.

Now let‚Äôs try HTTP2 client. In essence it will do same thing as HTTP1.1 client, it will connect to initial index page, fetch all books ids and request one book after another. The only difference is that the client will use <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed">HTTP2 multiplexing</a>. This means that instead of sending requests one after another and waiting for responses we‚Äôll send multiple requests at once and then we‚Äôll fetch responses. HTTP 1.1 allows you to reuse TCP connection but the process is:

</figure>In HTTP1.1 if you have one slow response it will block connection. In HTTP2 you can send multiple requests to your server over one connection at the same time and then fetch responses as they arrive from origin.

To use HTTP2 to its full capabilities our client is going to send multiple requests over one connection and then fetch responses. It will split initial list of 3000 books into chunks of 100 urls. For every chunk it will start with sending 100 requests. In next step it will iterate over connection stream ids and fetch responses.

I‚Äôm going to use <a href="https://github.com/Lukasa/hyper">python-hyper</a> as underlying client library. Twisted does not yet support HTTP2 client side, but work on supporting it is in progress.

</figure>To sum up HTTP2 client is faster, but it also works slightly differently. If you were to use HTTP2 in same way as HTTP1.1 (just send one request after another within one connection) performance difference would be small or non-existent. It‚Äôs also worth noting that I didnt go into details of other HTTP2 improvements (such as headers compression or server push). These other benefits of HTTP2 are certainly equally important as multiplexing of messages over one connection. I‚Äôm not sure if you can use server push from Twisted though.

<div class="info" style="text-align: left;">So I sort of fell into UX Design when I discovered a few years ago that what I was most passionate about was defining products and creating good, intuitive experiences that not only delighted users, but met product/business goals. My answer probably goes a bit more in depth than just learning the basics of UX design.

Here's a rough path to how I "picked up" UX design:</div>
<ol>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Read a few UX books such as Designing for the Digital Age, Don't Make Me Think, and The Inmates are Running the Asylum¬† (this is a good way to learn just the very basics of UX. Don't Make Me Think is pretty much the "bible" of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">My daily/weekly readings would consist of UX blogs such as Boxes and Arrows (also a good way of picking up the basic understandings of user experience design).</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">I took a class on User Experience just to get the fundamentals/basics down - this class actually didn't teach me a lot since much of it was stuff I was doing already.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Probably the most powerful method of practicing/picking up UX design skills is just by doing UX design. For fun, I would look at the websites of products/services I used then redesign them in Illustrator or Photoshop. My goal was to improve the experience while also lightly guiding the user towards actions that met whatever the goal was.</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Do user tests and user studies to see how people interact with products, and also to understand that what may be obvious to you or a product team isn't necessarily obvious to the end user. This is a good way to get a sense of how people interact with products - and also a good way to constantly remind yourself that you are not the target demographic. Real users think differently than those creating the products.¬†Before design and, more specifically, user experience, was getting as much attention as it is now, I was doing user studies and user testing. At the time, I didn't know that what I was doing was user experience research until I attended an event where Karlyn Neel (Quora is being really slow right now and won't let me tag anything or anyone, sorry), lead designer of eBay's mobile app, spoke. When she spoke about design and creating for the user, I had an epiphany of sorts, in that, what I wanted to do was define products and delight users. So every step I'd taken after that was to become a design product manager - which brings me to</li>
    <li class="info" style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue UX, then just start doing it even if you're in a position that's not technically in product or design. Example: I was working in the marketing department for a mid-stage startup where I owned the website. I treated the marketing site (the product was an API) like a product. I wasn't super passionate about Marketing beyond how I could get more visitors on our site to convert into leads, so I left and joined a gaming company as a design product manager. Now I'm a design product manager, or, product designer as we are more commonly known as.</li>
</ol>
Basically, what was once a hobby is now something I get paid for - except, it doesn't feel like just a job because I genuinely love doing what I'm doing. So if you're genuinely passionate about user experience and design, just start doing it and you'll learn the basics, and then some, as you go along.

<div class="info" style="text-align: left;">So I sort of fell into UX Design when I discovered a few years ago that what I was most passionate about was defining products and creating good, intuitive experiences that not only delighted users, but met product/business goals. My answer probably goes a bit more in depth than just learning the basics of UX design.

Here's a rough path to how I "picked up" UX design:</div>
<ol>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Read a few UX books such as Designing for the Digital Age, Don't Make Me Think, and The Inmates are Running the Asylum¬† (this is a good way to learn just the very basics of UX. Don't Make Me Think is pretty much the "bible" of user experience design).</li>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">My daily/weekly readings would consist of UX blogs such as Boxes and Arrows (also a good way of picking up the basic understandings of user experience design).</li>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">I took a class on User Experience just to get the fundamentals/basics down - this class actually didn't teach me a lot since much of it was stuff I was doing already.</li>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Probably the most powerful method of practicing/picking up UX design skills is just by doing UX design. For fun, I would look at the websites of products/services I used then redesign them in Illustrator or Photoshop. My goal was to improve the experience while also lightly guiding the user towards actions that met whatever the goal was.</li>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">Do user tests and user studies to see how people interact with products, and also to understand that what may be obvious to you or a product team isn't necessarily obvious to the end user. This is a good way to get a sense of how people interact with products - and also a good way to constantly remind yourself that you are not the target demographic. Real users think differently than those creating the products.¬†Before design and, more specifically, user experience, was getting as much attention as it is now, I was doing user studies and user testing. At the time, I didn't know that what I was doing was user experience research until I attended an event where Karlyn Neel (Quora is being really slow right now and won't let me tag anything or anyone, sorry), lead designer of eBay's mobile app, spoke. When she spoke about design and creating for the user, I had an epiphany of sorts, in that, what I wanted to do was define products and delight users. So every step I'd taken after that was to become a design product manager - which brings me to</li>
 	<li class="info" style="text-align: left;">If you want to pursue UX, then just start doing it even if you're in a position that's not technically in product or design. Example: I was working in the marketing department for a mid-stage startup where I owned the website. I treated the marketing site (the product was an API) like a product. I wasn't super passionate about Marketing beyond how I could get more visitors on our site to convert into leads, so I left and joined a gaming company as a design product manager. Now I'm a design product manager, or, product designer as we are more commonly known as.</li>
</ol>
Basically, what was once a hobby is now something I get paid for - except, it doesn't feel like just a job because I genuinely love doing what I'm doing. So if you're genuinely passionate about user experience and design, just start doing it and you'll learn the basics, and then some, as you go along.
